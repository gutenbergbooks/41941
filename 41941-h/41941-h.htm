<h2><a name="I-I" id="I-I">I.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">A DREAM OF YOUTH.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS seventeen years old; her name was
Urania.</p>

<p>Was Urania a fair, blue-eyed maiden, a
dream of spring, an innocent but inquisitive
daughter of Eve? No; she was simply, as in
days of yore, that one of the nine Muses who
presided over astronomy, and whose celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
glance inspired and directed the chorus of the
spheres; she was the angelic idea which soars
above terrestrial dulness. She had not the disturbing
flesh, nor the heart whose palpitations
are communicated at a distance, nor the gentle
ardor of human life; but she existed nevertheless
in a sort of ideal world,&mdash;lofty and always
pure,&mdash;and yet she was human enough in name
and form to produce a strong and deep impression
upon an adolescent soul, to arouse in that
soul an indefinite, indefinable feeling of admiration,&mdash;almost
of love.</p>

<p>In his hours of solitude, and even through
the intellectual labors with which the education
of the day overloads his brain, a young man
whose hand has never plucked the divine fruit
from the tree of Paradise, whose lips are still
untouched, whose heart has not yet spoken,
whose senses are beginning to awaken amid
vague new aspirations, thrills with a presentiment
of the divinity to which he is soon to sacrifice,
and personifies beforehand in ever-varying
forms the unknown being who floats through
the airy fabric of his dreams. He wishes, longs
to reach this unknown being, but dares not yet,
perhaps may never dare, in the purity of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
admiration, unless some helping hand come to
his aid. If Chloe is not well informed, indiscreet
and talkative Lycinion must take it upon
herself to instruct Daphnis.</p>

<p>Whatever tells us of the yet unknown attraction
can charm, interest, delight, and captivate
us. A cold engraving, showing the oval
of a pure face, even an old-fashioned painting,
a sculpture,&mdash;a sculpture especially,&mdash;awakens
a new feeling in our hearts; the blood flows
faster, or seems to stop; the idea crosses our
reddening brow like a flash, and remains floating
in our pensive mind. It is the beginning
of desires, the beginning of life, the dawn of a
beautiful summer day, harbinger of the sunrise.</p>

<p>As for me, my first love, my adolescent passion,
had, not for its object assuredly, but as a
determining cause&mdash;a clock! It is rather odd,
but so it is! Humdrum calculations used up
all my afternoons from two until four; it was
merely correcting observations, made the night
before, of stars or planets by applying the reductions
arising from atmospheric refraction,
which itself depends on the height of the barometer
and the temperature. These calculations
are as simple as they are tiresome; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
are made mechanically, by the help of prepared
tables, while thinking of something else.</p>

<p>The illustrious Le Verrier was then director
of the Paris Observatory. Although in no way
artistic, he had in his study a golden bronze
clock of very beautiful design, dating from the
end of the First Empire,&mdash;the work of Pradier's
chisel. The pedestal of this
clock represented in bas-relief
the birth of astronomy
on the Egyptian
plains. A massive
celestial sphere surrounded
by the zodiacal
circle, supported
by sphinxes, held the
dial; Egyptian gods
adorned the sides.
But the chief beauty
of this artistic work consisted of
an exquisite little statue of Urania, lithe, elegant,&mdash;I
had almost said majestic.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/illo_012.jpg" width="369" height="316" alt="" />

</div>

<p>The celestial Muse was standing. With her
right hand she measured the degrees of the
starry sphere by the aid of a compass; her
drooping left hand held a small astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
telescope. Superbly draped, she looked down
in an attitude of stately grandeur. I had never
before seen so beautiful a face as hers. With
the light falling directly upon it, the pure countenance
looked grave and austere. If the light
came to it obliquely, it appeared somewhat
meditative; but coming from above and from
the side, the enchanting face brightened with a
mysterious smile, her glance grew almost caressing,
her exquisite serenity gave place to an
expression of joy, amiability, and happiness
delightful to contemplate. It was like a song
of the soul, a poetic melody. These changes of
expression fairly made the statue alive. Muse
and goddess, she was beautiful, she was enchanting,
she was adorable.</p>

<p>Whenever I had occasion to go to the eminent
mathematician it was not his world-wide reputation
which impressed me most. I forgot the
formulas of logarithms, and even the immortal
discovery of the planet Neptune, to bow beneath
the charm of Pradier's work. The beautiful
figure so admirably modelled beneath its antique
drapery, the graceful throat, the expressive face,
attracted my eyes and captivated my thoughts.
Very often, as we were leaving the office about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
four o'clock to go back to Paris, I would peep
through the half-open door to see if the director
were absent. Monday and Wednesday were the
best days,&mdash;the first because of the Institute
meetings, which he seldom missed; the second
on account of the Bureau of Longitudes sessions,
which he avoided with the most profound disdain:
he would even leave the observatory expressly,
to make his contempt for them more
emphatic. Then I would stand before my dear
Urania and look at her to my heart's content,
enraptured by her beauty of form and face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
go away more satisfied, but not happier,&mdash;she
charmed, but filled me with regrets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/illo_014.jpg" width="439" height="362" alt="" />

</div>

<p>One evening&mdash;the evening on which I discovered
how the light could change her face&mdash;I
found the library-door wide open. A lamp stood
on the chimney-piece shedding its rays over the
Muse in one of her most bewitching aspects. The
slanting light lovingly caressed the brow, cheeks,
lips, and throat. Her expression was wonderful.
I went in, and for a while stood there in
motionless contemplation. Then I tried changing
the position of the lamp, making the light
play over the shoulders, arms, neck, and hair.
The statue seemed to live, to think, to awake,
and smile again! Odd, whimsical idea; strange
feeling! I had actually fallen in love! I had
changed from admirer to lover! If I had been
told then that what I felt was not real love,
and that this platonism was but a childish
dream, I should have been very incredulous.
The director came in, but did not seem so much
surprised at my presence as I might have feared.
(The study was often used to reach the observation
rooms.) "You are late for Jupiter," he
said, as I replaced the lamp on the chimney-piece;
and when I reached the threshold he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
added, "Can it be possible that you are a
poet?" lengthening out the last syllable as
though he had said "poët."</p>

<p>I might have answered him by quoting Kepler,
Galileo, D'Alembert, the two Herschels, and
other famous savants who were poets and astronomers
at the same time. I could have
reminded him that the first director of this
very observatory, Jean-Dominique Cassini, sang
of Urania in Latin, French, and Italian verse.
But the observatory pupils were not in the habit
of answering the senator-director in any way
whatever; senators were personages of importance
in those days, and the directorship of
the observatory was a life-office. Then too the
great geometrician would have looked upon the
most wonderful poem by Dante, Ariosto, or
Hugo with the same profound disdain that a
big Newfoundland dog would show if one should
put a glass of wine to his mouth. Besides, I
was clearly in the wrong.</p>

<p>How that charming figure of Urania haunted
me, with all the delicious changes of expression!
Her smile was so gracious, and sometimes her
bronze eyes had such a real look. She lacked
nothing but speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
That night, just as I fell asleep, I saw the
divine goddess again; and this time she spoke.</p>

<p>Oh, she was really living now! And what
a pretty mouth! I could have kissed each word.
"Come," she said, "come up into the sky.
Far away from the earth, you shall look down
upon this lower world, you shall contemplate
the great universe in its grandeur. Come and
see."</p>

<span class="smaller">UNKNOWN HUMANITIES.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HEN</span> I saw the Earth sinking down into
the yawning depths of immensity; the
cupolas of the observatory, Paris with its lights,
were rapidly fading away. Although feeling as
if I were motionless, I had the same sensation
which one experiences on rising in a balloon
and seeing the earth descend. I went up, up,
in a magic flight toward the inaccessible zenith.
Urania was with me, a little higher up, looking at
me kindly and pointing out the kingdoms below.
Day had come again. I recognized France, the
Rhine, Germany, Austria, Italy, the Mediterranean,
Spain, the Atlantic Ocean, the Channel,<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
England. But all this liliputian geography
soon shrank away. Speedily the terrestrial
globe was reduced to the dimensions of the
moon in its last quarter; then to a little full
moon.</p>

<p>"There," said she, "is the famous terrestrial
globe on which so many passions stir, within
whose narrow limits the thought of so many
millions of human beings is confined, whose
sight cannot extend beyond it. See how its
apparent size diminishes as our horizon develops.
We can no longer distinguish Europe
from Asia; and there is North America. How
very small it all is!"</p>

<p>As we passed through the Moon's neighborhood
I had noticed our satellite's hilly landscapes,
the mountain crests radiant with light,
deep valleys filled with shadows, and I should
have liked to stop for a nearer study of the
surroundings; but Urania did not deign to
bestow so much as a passing glance at it, and
drew me on in a rapid flight toward the sidereal
regions.</p>

<p>We were still ascending. The Earth grew
smaller and smaller as we receded from it, until
it looked like a simple star shining from solar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
illumination on the bosom of dark and empty
space. We turned toward the Sun, which shone
in space, but without filling it with light, so that
we could see stars and planets at the same
time, no longer obscured by its rays, because
it could not illumine empty space. The angelic
goddess showed me Mercury, in close neighborhood
to the Sun, Venus, shining on the other
side, the Earth, equalling Venus in appearance
and brilliancy, Mars, whose inland seas and
canals I recognized, Jupiter, with its four enormous
moons, Saturn, Uranus. "All these
worlds," said she, "are upheld in vacancy by
the attraction of the Sun, around which they
revolve with great speed. It is an harmonious
choir gravitating about its centre. The Earth
is but a floating island, a little hamlet of this
great solar country; and the solar empire itself
is but a little province on the breast of sidereal
vastness."</p>

<p>We rose still higher. The Sun and its system
were rapidly passing. The Earth was but
a little spot now; Jupiter himself, that colossal
world, had melted away, like Mars and Venus,
to a tiny little dot scarcely larger than the
Earth. We passed within sight of Saturn, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by his gigantic rings, whose study
alone would be sufficient to prove the immense
and unimaginable variety reigning in the universe.
Saturn is a whole system in itself, with
its rings composed of particles torn from it in
its dizzy revolution, and with its eight satellites
accompanying it like a celestial retinue.</p>

<p>As we soared aloft, our Sun decreased in
grandeur. Soon it had descended to the rank of
a planet, then lost all majesty, all superiority
over the sidereal population, and was nothing
more than a star, scarcely more brilliant than
the others. I looked about me at all this vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
extent, on whose spangled bosom we were still
going upward, and tried to recognize the constellations;
but their forms were beginning to
change perceptibly, from the lengthening perspective
caused by my journey. I thought
I could see that our Sun had insensibly
dwindled to a tiny star and joined the constellation
of the Centaur; while a new light, pale,
bluish, and very strange, seemed to greet me
from the direction toward which Urania was
bearing me. This new brightness had nothing
terrestrial about it, and reminded me of no
effect that I had ever seen on the Earth among
the changing tints of the sunset after a storm,
or in the undefined mists of morning, or during
the calm and silent moonlight hours on the
mirror of the sea. This last effect is nearer its
appearance; but the strange light was, and became
more and more, of a real blue,&mdash;blue,
not like a reflection of celestial azure, nor like
a contrast analogous to that produced by an
electric light compared with gas, but blue, as
if the Sun itself were blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/illo_023.jpg" width="421" height="367" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Imagine my amazement when I discovered
that we were approaching the influence of an
absolutely blue sun, like a shining disk, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
might have been cut from one of our most
beautiful terrestrial skies, standing out luminously
upon a perfectly black background all
thickly studded with stars. This sapphire sun
was the centre of a planetary system lighted by
its rays. We were to pass quite near one of
the planets. The blue sun increased perceptibly
in size; but&mdash;another phenomenon as singular
as the first&mdash;the light it threw upon this planet
seemed to be tinged on one side with green. I
looked into the sky again, and saw a second sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&mdash;this
one a beautiful emerald green. I could
not believe my eyes!</p>

<p>Urania said: "We are crossing the solar system
of Gamma Andromedæ, of which you see
but one part as yet; for it is made up, not
of these two suns, but in reality of three,&mdash;one
blue, one green, and one orange yellow. The
blue sun, which is the smallest, turns around the
green sun; and the latter gravitates with its
companion around the great orange sun, which
you will perceive in an instant."</p>

<p>Sure enough! A second later I saw a third
sun, colored with a glowing radiancy, whose
contrast with its two companions produced a
most dazzling illumination. I knew about this
interesting sidereal system from having observed
it more than once through the telescope; but I
had never suspected its real splendor. What
fiery depths! what scintillations! what brilliancy
of color in that strange source of blue
light in the second sun's green illumination and
the tawny, golden effulgence of the third!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">
<img src="images/illo_025.jpg" width="469" height="465" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But, as I have said, we were approaching one
of the worlds belonging to the system of the
sapphire sun. Everything was blue,&mdash;landscapes,
water, plants, rocks,&mdash;slightly greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on the side lighted by the second sun, and hardly
touched by the rays of the orange sun, which was
rising on the distant horizon. As we floated into
the atmosphere of this world a soft, delicious
music was wafted into the air like a perfume,
a dream. Never had I heard anything like it.
The sweet, deep, distant melody seemed to come
from a choir of harps and violins, strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by an accompaniment of organs. It was
an exquisite anthem, which charmed at once; it
needed no analyzing to be understood; it filled
the soul with ecstasy. It seemed to me that I
could have lingered there listening for an eternity.
I was so fearful of losing a single note
that I dared not speak to my guide. Urania
noticed it; stretching out her hand toward a
lake, she pointed to a group of winged beings
who were hovering over the blue waters.</p>

<p>They had not the earthly human form. They
were beings who had evidently been created to
live in air. They seemed woven out of light.
At a distance I thought they were dragon-flies;
they had their slender, graceful shape, the same
wide wings, quickness, and lightness. But on
examining them more closely I noticed their
height, which was not inferior to our own, and
realized from the expression of their eyes that
they were not animals. Their heads were very
like that of the dragon-fly, and like those aerial
creatures they had no legs. The delicious music
to which I had been listening was but the noise
of their flight. They were very numerous,&mdash;perhaps
many thousands.</p>

<p>From the mountain-tops could be seen plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which were neither trees nor flowers, whose
slender stalks rose to an enormous height; the
branched stems bearing, as though with outstretched
arms, great tulip-shaped cups. These
plants were alive, or as much so as our sensitive
growths, perhaps more, and like the <i class="taxonomy">desmodium</i>,
with its moving leaves, showed their internal
impressions by their motions. These groves
formed actual vegetable cities. The inhabitants
of this world had no other dwellings, but reposed
among the fragrant sensitive-plants when
not floating in the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illo_027.jpg" width="425" height="311" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"This seems a very strange world to you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
said Urania; "you are wondering what kinds
of ideas, habits, or history these people could
have,&mdash;what kinds of arts, literature, and sciences.
It would take a long time to answer all
the questions you might ask. Know only that
their eyes are superior to your finest telescopes;
that their nervous system vibrates at the passing
of a comet, and discovers by an electric
sense facts which you on the Earth will never
know. The organs which you see under their
wings serve as hands, more skilful than yours.
Instead of printing, they take the direct photography
of events and the phonetic impression
of words. They care very little for anything
but scientific research; that is to say, the study
of Nature. The three passions which absorb the
greater part of earthly life&mdash;eager greed for
fortune, political ambition, and love&mdash;are unknown
to them, because they require nothing
to live on, there are no international divisions
nor government, except a council of administration,
and because they are androgynous."</p>

<p>"Androgynous!" I repeated; and ventured
to add, "Is that best?"</p>

<p>"It is <i>different</i>. It is a great deal of trouble
saved to a humanity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"To be in a condition to understand the infinite
diversity displayed in the different phases
of creation," she continued, "it is necessary to
cast aside all terrestrial feelings and ideas. Just
as the species of your planet have changed in
succeeding ages from the uncouth creatures of
the first geological periods to the appearance
of man, and as even now the animal and vegetable
population of the Earth is still composed
of the most widely varying forms, from man
to the coral, from bird to fish, from an elephant
to a butterfly, so on an incomparably
vaster scale the forces of Nature have given
birth to an infinite diversity of beings and
things throughout the innumerable worlds of
heaven. The form of its occupant is the
result in each world of some element peculiar
to that globe,&mdash;substance, heat, light, electricity,
density, weight. Shape, functions, the
number of the senses,&mdash;you have but five, and
they are rather poor ones,&mdash;depend on the
vital conditions of each sphere. Life is earthly
on the Earth, Martial on Mars, Saturnian on
Saturn, Neptunian on Neptune,&mdash;that is to say,
appropriate to each habitation; or, to express
it better, more strictly speaking, produced and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
developed by each world according to its organic
condition, and following a primordial law which
all Nature obeys,&mdash;the law of progress."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/illo_030.jpg" width="424" height="462" alt="" />
</div>

<p>While she was speaking I had watched
the flight of the aerial creatures toward the
city of flowers, and saw with astonishment
that the plants were moving,
raising or lowering
themselves
to receive
them.
The green sun
had sunk beneath
the horizon,
and the
yellow sun had
risen in the
sky; the landscape
was suffused with a
fairy-like tinge, over
which hung an enormous half-green, half-orange
moon. Then the infinite melody which had been
filling the air died away, and amid a profound
silence I heard a song arise from so pure a voice
that no human tones could be compared with it.</p>

<p>"What a marvellous system!" I cried,&mdash;"a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
world illumined by such glowing lights! It is
having a close view of double, triple, and multiple
stars."</p>

<p>"Splendid suns those stars," she answered,
"gracefully united in the bonds of a mutual attraction;
from the Earth you see them cradled
two and two on the bosom of the sky, always
beautiful, pure, and luminous. Hanging in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
infinite, they lean to each other, but never touch,
as though their union, more moral than material,
were ordered by an invisible and superior
power, and following harmonious curves, they
gravitate in cadence around each other,&mdash;celestial
couples which blossomed at the spring-time
of creation in the constellated meadows of
infinity. While simple suns like yours shine
in the deserts of space solitary, fixed, and undisturbed,
double and multiple suns seem to
enliven the silent regions of the eternal void
by their motion, color, and life. These sidereal
time-keepers mark the centuries and eras of
other worlds for you.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/illo_031.jpg" width="421" height="463" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"But," she added, "let us continue our journey;
we are but a few trillion leagues from the
Earth."</p>

<p>"A few <i>trillion</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If we could hear the sounds of your
planet from here,&mdash;its volcanoes, cannonadings,
and thunders, or the wild vociferations of its
crowds in times of revolution, or the hymns
which rise to heaven from the churches,&mdash;the
distance is so great that, even admitting that
the noises could surmount it with the speed of
sound in the air, it would require not less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fifteen million years to reach here. We could
hear to-day only what took place on Earth fifteen
million years ago. And yet, compared with the
immensity of the universe, we are still very near
your home.</p>

<p>"You can still distinguish your Sun yonder,&mdash;that
tiny little star. We have not been out
of the universe to which it, with its system of
planets, belongs. That universe is composed of
several thousand milliards of suns, separated from
each other by trillions of leagues. Its extent is
so vast that it would take a flash of lightning
fifteen thousand years to cross it, travelling at
the rate of three hundred thousand kilometres
a second.</p>

<p>"And suns everywhere, on all sides! In
whatever direction we look, all about us are
sources of light, heat, and life in inexhaustible
variety,&mdash;suns of every lustre, of all magnitudes,
all ages, upheld in the eternal void, in
the luminous ether, by the mutual attraction of
all and the motion of each. Your Sun moves
and bears you away toward the constellation of
Hercules; that one, whose system we have just
crossed, goes south toward the Pleiades; Sirius
hurries away toward the Dove; Pollux whirls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
swiftly toward the Milky Way. All these millions,
these thousands of millions, of suns hasten
through boundless space with a speed which attains
a velocity of two, three, and even four
thousand metres a second. Motion maintains
the equilibrium of the universe, and constitutes
its organization, energy, and life."</p>

<h2><a name="I-III" id="I-III">III.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE INFINITE VARIETY OF BEINGS.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> tricolored system had long since disappeared
in our upward flight. We were
passing through the neighborhood of a great
many worlds which were very different from
our Earth. Some of them appeared to be
entirely covered with water, and peopled by
aquatic beings; others, occupied entirely by
plants. We stopped near several of them.
What unimaginable variety! The inhabitants
of one of them seemed to me especially beautiful.
Urania apprised me of the fact that their
organization was totally different from that of<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the children of Earth, and that those human beings
could discern the physico-chemical operations
which take place in the maintenance of
the body. In our earthly organism we do not
see, for example, how the food absorbed is assimilated,&mdash;how
the blood, tissues, and bones
renew themselves; all functions are fulfilled instinctively,
without thought perceiving it. Thus
man suffers from a thousand maladies whose
origin is hidden, and often undiscoverable.
There the human being feels the action of his
vital nourishment as we feel pleasure or pain.
A nerve starts from every particle of his body,
so to speak, which transmits the different impressions
it receives to the brain. If terrestrial
man were endowed with such a nervous system,
looking into his organism through the intermediary
of the nerves, he would see how food transforms
itself into chyle, the latter into blood,
blood into flesh, muscular, nervous substance,
etc.: he would see himself! But we are very
far from that, the centre of our perceptions
being obstructed by nerves, thickened by cerebral
lobes and optic thalami.</p>

<p>On another globe which we crossed during
the night&mdash;that is to say, on the side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
its nocturnal hemisphere&mdash;human eyes are
so constructed as to be <i>luminous</i>, and shine
as though some phosphorescent emanation
radiated from their strange centres. A night
meeting comprising a large number of these
persons presents an extremely fantastic appearance,
because the brilliancy, as well as the
color, of the eyes changes with the different passions
by which they are swayed. More than
that, the power of their glance is such that they
exert an <i>electric</i> and magnetic influence of variable
intensity, and which under certain conditions
has the effect of lightning, causing the
victim upon whom the force and energy of their
will is fixed to fall dead.</p>

<p>A little farther away my celestial guide
pointed out a world in which organisms enjoy
a precious faculty: the soul may change its
body without passing through the often disagreeable
and always sad experience of death.
A savant who has labored all his life for the
instruction of mankind, and feels that his end
is drawing near before he has been able to complete
his noble undertaking, can change bodies
with a youth, and begin a new life still more
useful than the first. The young man's consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and the magnetic manipulation of a competent
physician are sufficient for the transmigration.
Sometimes it happens that two persons united
by the sweet, strong ties of love effect such an
exchange of bodies after a union of many years,&mdash;the
husband's soul takes the wife's body, and
conversely, for the rest of their existence. The
inmost experience of life becomes incomparably
more complete for each of them. Savants and
historians desirous of living two centuries instead
of one, are seen to fall into a long artificial
winter's sleep, which suspends their lives for
half of each year, and even more. Some even
succeed in living three times longer than the
normal life of centenarians.</p>

<p>A few seconds later, crossing another system,
we met a kind of organism still more different
from ours, and assuredly far superior. With
the inhabitants of the planet we were then looking
at,&mdash;a world lighted by a brilliant hydrogenized
sun,&mdash;thought is not obliged to pass
through speech to be understood. How many
times has it not happened when a bright or
transcendent idea came into our minds, and we
wanted to utter it or write it out, that just as we
were about to speak or write, we felt that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
slipping away, flying from us, confused or metamorphosed
into something else? The inhabitants
of this planet have a sixth sense, which
might be called magneto-telegraphic, by virtue
of which, when the author is not disinclined, the
thought becomes outwardly manifest, and can
be read upon a feature which occupies very much
the same place as a forehead. These silent conversations
are often the deepest and most enjoyable,&mdash;always
the most sincere.</p>

<p>We are innocently disposed to believe that
the human organism is perfect, and leaves nothing
on earth to be desired; but for all that have
we not often regretted being obliged to listen,
in spite of ourselves, to disagreeable words, absurd
speeches, a sermon verbose with emptiness,
bad music, slander, or calumny? Our grammars
vainly pretend that we can "close our ears" to
these speeches; unfortunately there is no such
thing. You cannot shut your ears as you can
your eyes. I was very much surprised to find a
planet where Nature had not forgotten this salutary
provision. As we stopped there for an
instant, Urania pointed out ears which closed
like eyelids. "There is very much less anger
and vexation here than with you," said she;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
"but the wranglings of political parties are
much more sharp and vociferous, adversaries
are unwilling to listen to disputes, and succeed
effectually, notwithstanding the speakers may
be most loquacious."</p>

<p>On another world, in which phosphorus plays
a large part, whose atmosphere is constantly
electrified, whose temperature is very high,
and where the inhabitants have no sufficient
reason for inventing wearing apparel, certain
passions manifest themselves by the illumination
of some part of the body. It is the
same thing on a large scale that we see in our
terrestrial meadows on a smaller one in mild
summer evenings when glow-worms silently
manifest themselves, and then waste away in a
soft, amorous flame. It is very curious to observe
the appearance of these luminous couples
in the evening in populous cities. The color
of the phosphorescence differs in the sexes, and
its intensity varies with the age and temperament.
The stronger sex burns with a more or
less ardent red flame, and the gentler sex with
a bluish light, sometimes pale and diaphanous.
Our glow-worms, however, give but a very faint
and rudimentary idea respecting the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
impressions experienced by these peculiar beings.
I could not believe my eyes when we were passing
through the atmosphere of this planet. But
I was still more surprised on arriving at the
satellite of this unique world. That was a solitary
moon, lighted by a kind of twilight sun.
A sombre valley lay before us. From the trees
scattered on both slopes of the valley hung
human beings enveloped in shrouds. They had
tied themselves to the branches by their hair, and
were sleeping in the deepest silence. What I
had taken for grave-clothes was a covering
formed from the growth of their bleached and
tangled locks. As I was wondering at this marvellous
spectacle Urania told me this was their
usual mode of interment and resurrection. Yes,
on this world human beings enjoyed the organic
faculty of those insects which have the gift of
going to sleep in a chrysalis state, and metamorphosing
themselves into winged butterflies. It
is like a double human race; and the beings in
the first phase, even the coarsest and most material
of them, need but to die to rise again in the
most splendid of transformations. Each year
in this world represents about two hundred terrestrial
years. Two thirds of the year is lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in the lower condition, one third (winter) in the
chrysalis state, and the following spring the
sleepers feel life coming back to their transformed
flesh; they stir, awaken, leave their
fleecy coverings on the trees, and freeing themselves
from them, fly away, wonderful winged
creatures, to aerial regions, there to live for a
new Ph&oelig;nician year,&mdash;that is, for two hundred
years of our swiftly moving planet.</p>

<p>We crossed a great number of planets in this
way, and it seemed as though all eternity would
not be long enough to admit of my enjoying
these creations unknown to earth; but my
guide barely left me time to realize this, and
still new suns and new worlds were appearing.
We were very near striking against some
transparent comets in our rapid flight, that
were wandering about like a breath from one
system to another, and more than once I felt
myself strongly attracted toward wonderful
planets with fresh landscapes, whose occupants
would have been new objects of study. And
yet the celestial Muse bore me on without
fatigue still higher, still farther away, until at
last we came to what seemed to me the confines
of the universe. The suns grew more rare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
less luminous, paler; darkness was more intense
between the stars; and we were soon in the midst
of an actual desert, the thousands of millions of
stars which constitute the universe visible from
the Earth being far distant: everything had
faded to a little, lonely Milky Way in empty
infinity.</p>

<p>"At last we have reached the very limits
of creation!" I cried.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="dropleftmin">HAT</span> was that? Could it be true? Another
universe was coming down to us!
Millions and millions of suns grouped together
were floating about like a celestial archipelago,
and as we flew toward them they spread themselves
out like a limitless cloud of stars. I
looked about me on all sides, trying to pierce
the depths of boundless space, and saw similar
clusters of twinkling stars scattered about in all
directions, at various distances.</p>

<p>The new universe which we were entering
was made up principally of red, ruby, and garnet
suns. Many of them were absolutely blood-red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
It was like going through a magnificent display
of lightning. We sped swiftly from sun
to sun; but incessant electrical commotions like
the flashes of an aurora-borealis assailed us on
all sides. What strange abiding-places worlds
lighted solely by red suns must be! Then, too,
we saw in one section of this universe a secondary
group, composed of great numbers of rose-colored
and blue stars. Suddenly an enormous
comet, whose head was like some monster's open
jaws, rushed upon and enveloped us. I clung
terror-stricken to my goddess's side, who was for
a moment hidden from me by a luminous haze.
We were soon in a dark desert again, for the
second universe, like the first, was now far
away.</p>

<p>"Creation," she said, "comprises an infinite
number of distinct worlds, separated from each
other by abysses of vacancy."</p>

<p>"An <i>infinite</i> number?"</p>

<p>"A mathematical objection," she answered.
"Doubtless, no matter how great a number may
be, it cannot be actually infinite, since by
thought one can always increase by a unit, or
even double, treble, centuple it. But remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that the present is but a door through which the
future rushes to the past. Eternity is endless,

answered, "and never reach a definite limit.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A deep emotion had taken possession of my
mind. Urania's last words had pierced my very
marrow like an icy chill. "Never any end&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>never!
never," I repeated; I could think or
speak of nothing else. But still the magnificence
of the spectacle appealed to my eyes, and my
feeling of annihilation gave place to enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Astronomy," I cried, "is everything! To
know these things, to live in the infinite,&mdash;oh,
Urania! what are other human ideas compared
with science? Shadows, phantoms!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you will wake up again upon the
Earth," she said; "you will admire, and rightly
too, the wisdom of your masters. But understand
this,&mdash;the astronomy of your schools
and observatories, mathematical astronomy,
the beautiful science as known to Newton,
Laplace, Le Verrier, is not yet definite,
actual knowledge.</p>

<p>"That, O my son! is not the end which I
have pursued since the days of Hipparchus and
Ptolemy. Look at the thousands of suns analogous
to that which gives life to the earth, which
like it are sources of light, motion, activity, and
splendor! Ah! that is the object of the science
to come,&mdash;the study of universal and eternal
life. Until now, no one has ever entered the
temple. Figures are not an end, but a means;
they do not represent Nature's structure, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the methods, the scaffoldings. You are to see
the dawn of a new day. Mathematical astronomy
will yield her place to physical astronomy,
to the true study of Nature.</p>

<p>"Yes," she continued, "astronomers who
calculate the movements of the stars in their
daily passage of the meridian, those who foretell
eclipses, celestial phenomena, periodical comets,
who observe the exact positions of the stars and
planets on the different degrees of the celestial
sphere so carefully; those who discover comets,
planets, satellites, and variable stars; those who
investigate and determine the disturbance caused
the Earth's motion by attraction from the Moon
and planets; those who consecrate their night-watches
to the discovery of the fundamental
elements of the world's system,&mdash;are all of them
calculators and observers, precursors of the new
astronomy. These are immense labors, studies
worthy of admiration, and important works
which bring to light the highest faculties of the
human mind. But it is the army of the past;
mathematicians and geometricians. Henceforth,
the hearts of savants will throb for a still
nobler conquest. All these great minds never
really left the Earth while studying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
skies. Astronomy's aim is not to show us
the apparent position of shining specks, nor
to weigh stones moving through space, nor
to foretell eclipses, or the phases of the
Moon or tides. All this is fine, but it is not
enough.</p>

<p>"If life did not exist upon the earth, that
planet would be absolutely devoid of interest
for any mind whatsoever; and the same remark
is applicable to all the worlds which gravitate
around the thousands of millions of suns in
the wide stretches of immensity. Life is the
object of the whole creation. If there were
neither life nor thought, it would all be null
and void.</p>

<p>"You are destined to witness an entire transformation
in science. Matter will give place to
mind."</p>

<p>"Life universal!" I asked: "Are all the
planets of our solar system inhabited? Are the
myriads of worlds which people the infinite
lived upon? Do those forms of human life
resemble ours? Shall we ever know them?"</p>

<p>"The epoch of your life upon the earth, even
the duration of terrestrial humanity, is but a
moment in eternity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I did not understand this answer to my
questions.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why all the worlds
should be inhabited <i>now</i>," she went on. "The
present period is of no more importance than
those which preceded or will follow it.</p>

<p>"The length of the Earth's existence will be
longer&mdash;much longer, perhaps ten times longer&mdash;than
that of its vital human period. Out of
a dozen worlds selected by chance from immensity,
we could, for example, find hardly one
inhabited by a really intelligent race. Some
have been already, others will be in the future;
these are in preparation, those have run
through all their phases: here cradles, there
graves. And then too an infinite variety in the
forces of Nature and their manifestations is
revealed; earthly life being in no way the type
of extra-terrestrial existence. Beings can think,
live, in wholly different organizations from
those with which you are familiar on your
own planet. Inhabitants of the other worlds
have neither your form nor senses; they are
otherwise.</p>

<p>"The day will come, and very soon, since
you are called to see it, when the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the conditions of life in the various provinces
of the universe will be astronomy's essential
aim and chief charm. Soon, instead of
being concerned simply about the distance, the
motion, and the material facts of your neighboring
planets, astronomers will discover their
physical constitution,&mdash;for example, their geographical
appearance, their climatology, their
meteorology,&mdash;will solve the mystery of their
vital organizations, and will discuss their inhabitants.
They will find that Mars and Venus
are actually peopled by thinking beings;
that Jupiter is still in its primary period
of organic preparation; that Saturn looks
down upon us under quite different conditions
from those which were instrumental in the
establishment of terrestrial life, and without
passing through a state analogous to that of
Earth, will be inhabited by beings incompatible
with earthly organisms. New methods will tell
about the physical and chemical constitutions
of the stars and the nature of their atmospheres.
Perfected instruments will permit the discovery
of direct proofs of existence in these planetary
humanities and the idea of putting one's self in
communication with them. This is the scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
transformation which will mark the close
of the nineteenth century and inaugurate the
twentieth."</p>

<p>I listened with delight to these words of the
celestial Muse, which shed an entirely different
light upon the future of astronomy and filled
me with renewed ardor. Before my eyes was
a panorama of innumerable worlds moving in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
space, and I understood that the true object of
science is to teach us about those far distant
universes and allow us to live in those wide
horizons. The beautiful goddess resumed:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illo_053.jpg" width="425" height="438" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Astronomy's mission will be still higher.
After making you know and feel that the Earth
is but a city in the celestial country, and man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a citizen of heaven, she will go still farther.
Disclosing the plan on which the physical universe
is constructed, she will show that the
moral universe is constructed on the very same
basis, that the two worlds form but one world,
and that mind governs matter. What she will
have done for space she will do for time. After
realizing the boundlessness of space, and recognizing
that the same laws govern all places
simultaneously and make the vast universe one
grand unit, you will learn that the centuries
of the past and of the future are linked with
the present, and that thinking monads will
live forever through successive and progressive
changes. You will learn that minds exist incomparably
superior to the greatest minds of
earthly humanity, and that all things advance
toward supreme perfection. You will learn too
that the material form is but an appearance,
and that the real being consists of an imponderable,
intangible, and invisible form.</p>

<p>"Astronomy will then be eminently and
above all else the directress of philosophy.
Those who reason without astronomical knowledge
will never reach the truth. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
follow her beacon faithfully will gradually rise
to the solutions of the greatest problems.</p>

<p>"Astronomical philosophy will be the religion
of lofty minds.</p>

<p>"You will see this double transformation in
science," she added, "when you leave the terrestrial
globe; the astronomical knowledge
which you already so justly prize will be entirely
remodelled in form as well as spirit.</p>

<p>"But this is not all. The renewal of an old
science will be of little use to mankind in general
if these sublime truths which develop the
mind, enlighten the soul, and free it from vulgar
common-place should be kept shut up within the
narrow limits of professional astronomers. This
time too will pass away. We must begin anew.
The torch must be taken in hand, and its glory
increased by carrying it into the busy streets and
public squares. Every one is called to receive
the light, every one is thirsting for it,&mdash;especially
the humble, those on whom fortune frowns, for
these are the persons who think most; these are
eager for knowledge, while the contented ones
of the century do not suspect their own ignorance,
and are almost proud of staying in it.
Yes, the light of astronomy must be diffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
throughout the world; it must filter through
the strata of humanity to the popular masses,
enlighten their consciences, elevate their hearts.
That will be its most beautiful and its grandest,
greatest mission!"</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HUS</span> spoke my celestial guide. Her face
was glorious as the day, her eyes shone
with a starry lustre, her voice was like divine
music. I looked at the worlds about us revolving
in space, and felt that a mighty harmony
controlled the course of Nature.</p>

<p>"Now let us return to the Earth," she said,
pointing to the spot where our terrestrial Sun
had disappeared. "But look again. You understand
now that space is infinite; you will
soon comprehend that time is eternal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
We crossed other constellations and came back
toward the solar system. I saw the Sun reappear,
looking like a little star.</p>

<p>"For an instant," said she, "I am going to
give you, if not divine, at least angelic sight.
Your soul shall feel the ethereal vibrations
which constitute light itself, and shall know
that the history of each world is eternal with
God. To see is to know: behold!"</p>

<p>Just as a microscope shows us an ant as large
as an elephant, and penetrates the infinitely
small, making the invisible visible, so at the
Muse's command my sight suddenly acquired an
unknown power of perception, and distinguished
the Earth in space, very near the Sun, which
was in eclipse, and from invisible it became
visible.</p>

<p>I recognized it; and as I watched, its disk
grew larger, looking like the Moon a few days
before the full. After a while I could distinguish
the principal geographical aspects in the
growing disk,&mdash;the snowy patch at the North
Pole, the outlines of Europe and Asia, the North
Sea, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean. The more
steadily I fixed my gaze, the better I could see.
Details became more and more perceptible, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
if I were gradually changing the lenses of a
microscope. I recognized the geographical form
of France; but our beautiful country appeared
to be entirely green,&mdash;from the Rhine to the
Ocean, from the Channel to the Mediterranean,
as if it were covered with one immense forest.
I succeeded, however, better and better in distinguishing
the slightest details, for the Alps,
the Pyrenees, the Rhine, the Rhone, the Loire,
were easily found.</p>

<p>"Pay great attention," murmured my companion.</p>

<p>As she said this, she placed the tips of her
slender fingers lightly on my brow, as though
she had wished to magnetize my brain and endow
my perceptive faculties with still greater
power. Then I looked again more intently at
the vision, and saw before my eyes Gaul in
the time of Julius Cæsar. It was during the
war of independence aroused by the patriotism
of Vercingetorix.</p>

<p>"We are at such a distance from the Earth,"
said Urania, "that light requires all the time
that separates us from Julius Cæsar to reach
here. Only the rays of light that left the Earth
at that time come to us; and yet light travels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
at the rate of three hundred thousand kilometres
a second. It is fast, very fast, but it is not
instantaneous. Astronomers on the Earth, who
are observing stars situated as far from them
as we are now, do not see them as they really
are, but as they
were when the
rays of light
which they see
to-day left them;
that is to say,
as they were
more than eighteen
centuries
ago.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/illo_060.jpg" width="407" height="329" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"One never sees the stars
from the Earth, nor from any
point in space, as they are,
but as they have been," she
continued; "the farther away from them
one is, the more behind he is in their history.</p>

<p>"You observe most carefully through the telescope
stars which no longer exist. Many of the
stars visible to the naked eye are no longer in
existence. Many of the nebulæ whose substance
you analyze through the spectroscope have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
suns. Many of your most beautiful red
stars are extinct and dead; you would not
detect them if you should go to them.</p>

<p>"The light shed from all the suns which people
immensity, the light reflected into space from
all the worlds irradiated by these suns, carries
away through the boundless skies photographs
of all the centuries every day, every second.
Looking at a star, you see it as it was at the
time the impression that you receive left it,&mdash;just
as when you hear a clock strike, you receive
the sound after it has left it, and as long after
as you are far from it.</p>

<p>"The result is, that the history of all these
worlds actually travels through space, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
entirely disappearing; that all past events are
present and indestructible in the bosom of the
infinite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/illo_061.jpg" width="395" height="273" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"The universe will endure forever. The Earth
will come to an end, and some day will be nothing
but a tomb. But there will be new suns
and new earths, new springs and new smiles,
and life will always bloom afresh in the limitless
and endless universe.</p>

<p>"I wanted to show you," said she, after a
pause, "how eternal time is! You have felt the
infinity of space, you have understood the grandeur
of the universe. Now your celestial journey
is over. We must go back to the earth and your
own home again.</p>

<p>"For yourself," she added, "know that study
is the one source of any intellectual value; be
neither rich nor poor; keep yourself from all
ambition as well as from all servitude; be independent,&mdash;independence
is the rarest gift
and the first condition of happiness."</p>

<p>Urania was still speaking in her gentle
voice; but my brain was so confused by the
commotion aroused in it by so many extraordinary
scenes that I was seized by a fit of
trembling. A shiver ran over me from head to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
foot, which was probably the cause of my abrupt
awakening in a state of great agitation. Alas!
the delightful celestial journey had ended.</p>

<p>I looked about for Urania, but could not find
her. A bright moonbeam shining through my
bedroom window lightly touched the edge of
a curtain and seemed vaguely to outline the
aerial form of my heavenly guide; but it was
only a moonbeam.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When I went back to the observatory the
next morning, my first impulse was to find
some pretext for going to the director's study
to see the charming Muse again who had
rewarded me by such a dream....</p>

<p>The clock had disappeared!</p>

<p>In its place stood a white marble bust of the
illustrious astronomer.</p>

<p>I looked through the other rooms, even the
private apartments, under a thousand different
excuses; but she was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>I searched for days and weeks, but could
neither find her nor learn what had become
of her.</p>

<p>I had a friend and confidant, very near my
own age, although appearing older, from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sprouting beard; he too was very fond of the
ideal, and perhaps even more of a dreamer,&mdash;besides,
he was the only person at the observatory
with whom I was ever on intimate terms.
He shared my joys and griefs. We had the
same tastes, the same ideas, the same feelings.
He understood my youthful admiration for the
statue, the personality with which my imagination
had invested her, and my unhappiness
at having thus suddenly lost my dearest Urania
just when I was most attached to her. He had
more than once admired with me the effect of
the light upon her celestial countenance, and
smiled at my ecstasies like a big brother, even
teasing me a little sharply about my affection
for an idol, going so far as to call me "Camille
Pygmalion." But at heart I knew that he
too loved her.</p>

<p>This friend&mdash;who, alas! was to be torn from
me a few years later, in the very flower of his
youth, kind George Spero, exalted mind, noble
heart, whose memory will be ever dear to me&mdash;was
the director's private secretary; and
his sincere affection for me was proved in
this instance by an act of kindness as graceful
as it was unexpected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
When I went home one day I saw with a
half-incredulous bewilderment the famous clock
standing on my chimney-piece there, just in
front of me!</p>

<p>It was really she! How did she come there?
What brought her there? Where did she
come from?</p>

<p>I learned that the celebrated discoverer of
Neptune had sent it to one of the principal
clock-makers in Paris to be repaired; that the
latter had received a most interesting antique
astronomical clock from China and had offered
it in exchange, which had been accepted; and
that George Spero, to whom the transaction
had been intrusted, had re-purchased Pradier's
work as a gift for me. His parents were glad
of an opportunity to please me, in remembrance
of some lessons in mathematics which I had
given George for his special examination.</p>

<p>What joy it was to see my Urania again!
How happy I was to feast my eyes on her once
more! That charming personification of the
Muse of heaven has never left me since. In
my studious hours the beautiful statue always
stood before me, seeming to remind me of the
goddess's conversation,&mdash;to tell me the destinies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of astronomy, to direct me in my youthful scientific
aspirations. Since then more passionate
emotions have beguiled me, captivated me, and
troubled my senses; but I shall never forget the
ideal sentiment with which the Muse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stars had inspired me, the celestial journey on
which she bore me away, the unexpected panoramas
she unrolled before my eyes, the truths
she revealed to me as to the extent of the
universe, nor the happiness she gave me by
definitively settling my mind on the calm contemplation
of Nature and science as a career.</p>

From the heights of Passy the view
extended over the whole of the great city,
which at that time, more than ever before,
was not a city, but a world. The Universal
Exhibition of 1867 had lavished all the attrac<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>tions
and delights of the century on imperial
Paris. The flowers of civilization were blooming
in their most brilliant tints, wasting themselves
away by the very ardor of their perfume,&mdash;fading,
dying in the full fever of youth. The
crowned heads of Europe had just heard a
deafening trumpet-blast there, which was the
last of the monarchy; science, arts, industry
had sowed their newest creations broadcast,
with an inexhaustible prodigality. It was a
general delirium of men and things. Regiments
were marching, with music at their
heads; swift-rolling vehicles crossed each other
from all directions; thousands of people were
moving about in the dust on the avenues, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quais</i>,
and boulevards: but the very dust, gilded by
the rays of the setting sun, crowned the splendid
city like an aureole. The tall buildings,
towers, and steeples were ablaze with reflections
from the fiery orb; tones from a distant
orchestra, mingled with a confused murmur of
voices and other sounds,&mdash;the brilliant, fit ending
of a dazzling summer day,&mdash;poured into
the soul an undefined feeling of contentment,
happiness, and satisfaction. There was a kind
of symbolical summing-up about it of the evi<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>dences
of the vitality of a great people in the
zenith of its life and fortune.</p>

<p>From the heights of Passy, where we are, on
a terrace in a garden overhanging the careless
current of the stream, as in the old days at
Babylon, two persons, leaning on the stone balustrade,
watch the noisy scene, looking down on
the restless surface of the human sea, happier
in their sweet solitude than all the atoms of
that seething whirlpool; they do not belong
to the every-day world, but soar above all
that restless activity in the limpid atmosphere
of their own joy. Their spirits feel, their
hearts love; or to express the same fact more
completely, their souls live.</p>

<p>In the maidenly beauty of her eighteenth
spring, the young girl's glance wanders dreamily
over the apotheosis of the setting sun.
Happy to be alive, happier still to love, she
gives no thought to the thousands of people
moving about at her feet; she looks with unseeing
eyes at the sun's ardent disk sinking
below the purple western clouds; she breathes
the perfumed air from garlands of roses in the
garden, and feels through her whole being the
peace of perfect happiness, singing a hymn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unutterable love in her heart. The blond hair
waves about her brow like a misty aureole, and
falls in thick tresses over her slender form; her
blue eyes, fringed by long dark lashes, are like
a reflection of the azure sky; her neck and arms
give glimpses of the snowy whiteness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
skin; her cheeks, her ears, are softly colored;
her whole person recalls somewhat the dainty
marchionesses whom the painters of the eighteenth
century loved to depict, who were born
to an unknown life which they were not long
destined to enjoy. She is standing. Her companion,
whose arm a
moment ago encircled
her waist as they
were looking at
the picture of
Paris and listening
to the strains
of melody flooding
the air from
the Imperial
Guard, had seated
himself by her side.
His eyes had forgotten Paris and the setting
sun; now they see nothing but the beautiful
girl. He looks at her unconsciously with a
strange, fixed gaze, as though he saw her now
for the first time, and could not keep his eyes
from her exquisite profile, enveloping her in a
long look like a magnetic caress.</p>

<p>The young student was absorbed in his contemplation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Was he still a student at twenty-five?
Is one ever anything more? And our
own master then, M. de Chevreul, does he not
call himself now, in his one hundred and third
year, the senior of the students of France?
George Spero had finished his lyceum studies
at a very early age; but they teach nothing,
unless it be how to work, and he continued to
investigate the great problems of natural science
with indefatigable ardor. Astronomy especially
had at first attracted his interest. I
had known him (as the reader of the first part
of this book may remember) at the Paris
Observatory, which he had entered at the age
of sixteen, and where he had somewhat distinguished
himself by a rather strange peculiarity,&mdash;that
of having no ambition and no
desire whatever for advancement.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen, as at twenty-five, he believed
himself to be on the verge of the grave,&mdash;judging,
perhaps, that life indeed passes quickly,
and that it is useless to wish for anything beyond
the happiness of studying and knowing.
He was not very talkative, although at heart
his disposition was that of a playful child.
His small, well-shaped mouth seemed to smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
if one carefully examined its corners; otherwise
it looked somewhat pensive, and as though
made for silence. His eyes, whose undecided
color reminded one of the bluish-green on the
sea's horizon, changed with the light and in
accordance with his moods; they were usually
gentle, but on occasion would flash like lightning,
or grow as cold as steel; their glance was
deep, sometimes unfathomable, even strange and
enigmatical. His ear was small, gracefully
curved, the lobe well detached and a little
raised,&mdash;which to analysts is an indication of
refinement. The brow was broad, although his
head was rather small, but seemed larger from
his glistening, thickly waving hair; his beard
was brown, like his hair, and slightly curled.
Of medium height, his whole effect was elegant,
with a natural ease; he dressed carefully,
but without pretence or affectation.</p>

<p>My friends and I never had any special companionship
with him. Holidays and leisure
hours he never spent with us. Always occupied
with his books, he seemed to have given himself
up without reserve to hunting for the philosopher's
stone, the quadrature of the circle, or
perpetual motion. I never knew him to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
friend, unless it were myself; and yet I am not
sure that he gave me all his confidences,&mdash;though,
for that matter, perhaps there was no
special event in his life except the one of which
I now make myself the historian, and which I
knew all about as an eye-witness if not as
confidant.</p>

<p>The problem of the soul was the perpetual
torment of his thought. Sometimes he was so
absorbed in his search for the unknown, with
such intense cerebral action, that he felt a sensation
of tingling in his head which seemed to
exhaust all his thinking faculties. This was
especially the case when, after having analyzed
the conditions of immortality for a long time,
he saw real ephemeral life suddenly disappear,
and endless immortality open before his mental
being. In the face of this aspect of the soul
in full eternity he longed <i>to know</i>. The sight
of his own body, pale and stiff, wrapped in
grave-clothes and lying in its coffin, left deserted
in its last mournful resting-place at the
bottom of a narrow grave under the grass
where the cricket chirps, did not appall his
thought so much as the uncertainty about the
future. "What will become of me; what will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
become of us?" he repeated, like the constant
clashing of a fixed idea in his brain. "If we
die utterly, what an absurd farce life is, with
its hopes and struggles. If we are immortal,
what do we do with ourselves through endless
eternity? Where shall I be a hundred years
from now? Where will all the present dwellers
of the earth be? To die, for ever and ever; to
have existed but for a moment! What a mockery!
Would it not be better a hundred times
over never to have been born? But if it be
our fate to live eternally and never to be able
to change anything of the fatality that carries
us along,&mdash;having endless eternity always before
us,&mdash;how can we bear the burden of such
a destiny? Is that the doom awaiting us? If
we should tire of existence, we should be forbidden
to fly from it; it would be impossible
to end it. In this conception there is far more
implacable cruelty than in that of an ephemeral
life vanishing away like an insect's flight in
the fresh evening breeze. Why then were we
born? To suffer uncertainty; to find after examination
not a single one of our hopes left; to
live like idiots if we do not think, like fools if
we do? And yet they tell us of a 'good God!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
There are religions, priests, rabbis, bonzes.
Why, mankind is but a race of dupes and
duped! Religion is the same as patriotism,
and the priest is as good as the soldier. Men
of all nations arm themselves to the teeth
that they may kill one another like simpletons!
Ah! it is the wisest thing they could
do; the best return they could make to Nature
for the foolish gift she bestowed in causing
them to be born."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I tried to lessen his pain and anxiety, having
a certain philosophy of my own which was
relatively satisfactory to me. "The fear of
death seems absolutely chimerical," said I.
"There are but two hypotheses to make about
it: every night it may be that we shall not
wake again the next morning; and yet, when
we think of it, this idea does not prevent our
going to sleep. Now, then, first, either all
being ended with life, we do not wake again
anywhere,&mdash;and in that case it is a sleep that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
has not ended, but which will endure throughout
eternity, so that we shall never know anything
about it,&mdash;or else, secondly, the soul
outliving the body, we shall wake up somewhere
else and continue our activity. In that
case there is nothing to fear in the awakening,&mdash;it
should rather attract us. There is a
reason for all things in Nature; and every
creature, the meanest as well as the noblest,
finds his happiness in the exercise of his
faculties."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">

</div>

<p>This reasoning seemed to calm him; but the
restlessness of doubt soon returned, pricking
like thorns. Sometimes he would wander off
alone through the spacious cemeteries of Paris,
seeking out the most deserted alleys between
the graves, listening to the wind among the
trees, and the rustle of the leaves in the paths.
Sometimes he went away into the woods in the
suburbs of the great city, and would walk about
for hours at a time muttering to himself. At
other times he would spend a whole day in his
study in the Place du Panthéon, which he used
as study, work and reception room at the same
time; and there, until far into the night, he
would dissect a brain brought back from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
clinic, studying the small slices of gray substance
through his microscope.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the sciences called positive,
the sudden halt to his mind in the solution
of these problems, threw him into fits of deepest
despair; and I have found him many times in a
state of utter prostration, his eyes set and shining,
his hands burning with fever, his pulse
agitated and intermittent. In one of these
crises I was obliged to leave him for a few
hours, and almost feared I should not find him
alive on my return, at about five o'clock in the
morning. He had near him a glass of cyanide
of potassium, which he tried to hide as I came
in; but recovering his calmness almost at once,
he said, with great serenity and a slight smile,
"What is the good? If we are immortal, it
would be of no use, and I wanted to know
about it sooner." That day he acknowledged
he believed that he had been lifted painfully
by his hair to the ceiling, and allowed to drop
with all his weight upon the floor.</p>

<p>Public indifference with regard to the great
problem of human destiny,&mdash;a question which
in his eyes exceeded all others in importance,
since it treated of our continued existence or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
destruction,&mdash;exasperated him to the last degree.
All about him he saw people who were
occupied solely by material interests, entirely
absorbed by the foolish idea of "making money,"
for which they gave up all their years, their
days, their hours, their minutes, disguised under
various forms; and he found no free, independent
mind living an intellectual life. It
seemed to him that sentient beings could, <i>should</i>,
while living the bodily life, since one cannot
do otherwise, at least not remain the slaves of
so coarse an organization, but devote the best
moments to their intellectual life.</p>

<p>At the time this story begins, George Spero
was already well known, and even famed, by
the original scientific books which he had published,
and also by several books of high literary
merit, which had won praise for his name in
all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Although he had not yet completed his twenty-fifth
year, thousands of persons had read his
books, which, however, were not written for
the general public, but had been so successful
as to be appreciated by the majority who
desire to learn, as well as by the enlightened
minority. He had been proclaimed master of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
new school, and eminent critics, knowing neither
his physical individuality nor his age, spoke of
his "doctrines."</p>

<p>How did it happen that this philosopher of
such rare ability, this stern student, should be
at a young girl's feet at sunset on the terrace
where we met them just now? The rest of
the story will tell you.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE APPARITION.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HEIR</span> first meeting had been a very strange
one. The young naturalist was a passionate
admirer of the beauties of Nature, and
was always looking for grand effects. The year
before, he had made a journey to Norway to
visit the silent fiords, in which the sea was
swallowed up; the mountains, whose snow-crowned
summits lift their spotless brows far
above the clouds; and to make a special study
of the aurora borealis,&mdash;that most magnificent
exhibition of our planet's life. I had accompanied
him on the journey. The sunsets over
the deep, calm fiords, the rise of the splendid<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
orb on the mountains, charmed his poetic and
artistic soul with an indescribable emotion. We
remained there more than a month, going
through the picturesque region of the Scandinavian
Alps. Now, Norway was the home of
that child of the North who was to exert so
strong an influence over his unawakened heart.
She was there, only a few steps away from him;
and yet it was not until the very day we left
that Chance, that god of the ancients, decided to
bring them together.</p>

<p>The morning light was gilding the distant
summits. The young Norwegian girl's father
had brought her to one of the mountains much
frequented by excursionists, like the Righi in
Switzerland, to see the sunrise, which that day
was of surpassing beauty. To better distinguish
certain details of the landscape, Icléa had
mounted a little hillock a few yards farther
away, and was quite alone; when turning with
her face from the sun to embrace the whole
horizon, she saw her own image, her whole
figure, not on the mountain nor the earth, but
on the very sky itself. A luminous aureole
framed her head and shoulders with a shining
crown of glory, and a large aerial circle, faintly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tinted with the colors of the rainbow, surrounded
the mysterious apparition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/illo_088.jpg" width="463" height="603" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Astonished and touched by the singularity of
the vision, and still under the influence of the
gorgeous sunrise, she did not at first notice that
another face, that of a man, was by the side of
her own,&mdash;the motionless silhouette of a traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in contemplation before her, recalling the
statues of saints on their pedestals in churches.
This masculine figure and her own were framed
in by the same aerial circle. Suddenly she
perceived the strange profile in the air, and
thought herself the plaything of a fantastic
vision; she started back in her amazement
with a gesture of surprise, almost of fear.
Her image in the air reproduced the same
gesture, and she saw the traveller's wraith
put his hand to his hat and take it off, as if
he were bowing to the heavens, then lose the
clearness of its outlines, and fade away at the
same time as her own figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/illo_089.jpg" width="478" height="523" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The transfiguration on Mount Tabor when
the disciples of Jesus suddenly saw their Master's
image on the sky, accompanied by those of
Moses and Elias, could not have caused its
witnesses any greater stupefaction than the
innocent Norwegian girl felt before this <i>anthelion</i>,
whose theory is well known to all
meteorologists.</p>

<p>This apparition fixed itself upon her mental
retina like a marvellous dream. She called her
father, who had remained a few steps away from
the little mound; but when he reached her it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had all disappeared. She asked him to explain
it; but he replied only by a doubt, almost a
denial, of the truth of the phenomenon. The
excellent man, formerly a field-officer, belonged
to that category of distinguished sceptics who
simply deny everything of which they are ignorant
or which they cannot explain. It was all
in vain that the lovely girl assured him that
she had seen her reflection in the sky, and
also that of a man whom she judged was
young and good-looking; all in vain that she
related the details of the apparition, and added
that the figures were much larger than life-size,
like enormous silhouettes,&mdash;he declared
authoritatively and with considerable emphasis
that it was what is called an optical illusion,
produced by the imagination when one has not
slept well, particularly in youth.</p>

<p>But on the evening of that day, as we were
going on board the steamer, I noticed a young
girl, with wind-tossed hair, who was looking at
my friend in open astonishment. She had her
father's arm, and was standing on the wharf as
motionless as Lot's wife turned into a pillar of
salt. I signed to my friend; but no sooner had
he turned his head towards her than I saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
face crimson with a sudden flush: she at once
turned away, and fixed her eyes on the paddle-wheel,
which was just beginning to move. I do
not know whether Spero noticed her confusion.
As a fact, we had seen nothing of that morning's
aerial phenomenon, at least not while the
young girl was near us, and she had been hidden
from us by a little clump of bushes; the
magnificence of the sunrise had drawn us rather
to the western side. However, he saluted Norway,
which he regretted to leave, with the same
gesture with which he had greeted the rising
sun, and the pretty stranger had taken the bow
for herself.</p>

<p>Two months later, the Comte de K&mdash;&mdash; gave
a large reception in honor of the recent successes
of his compatriot, Christine Nilsson. The
young Norwegian girl and her father, who had
come to Paris to pass a part of the winter, were
among the guests, who had long known each
other as fellow-countrymen, Norway and Sweden
being sisters. We went there for the first time,
our invitation being due to the appearance of
Spero's latest book, which had already met with
signal success. Icléa was a dreamy, thoughtful
girl, well informed, thanks to the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
education given in Northern countries; she was
eager to learn, and had read and re-read with
curiosity the somewhat mystical book in which
the new metaphysician, dissatisfied with Pascal's
"Thoughts," had laid bare his soul's anxieties.
Several months before, she had successfully
passed the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brevet supérieur</i> examination; and
having abandoned the study of medicine, which
had at first attracted her, was beginning to
look with some curiosity into the recent investigations
of psychological physiology.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/illo_093.jpg" width="459" height="321" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When M. George Spero was announced, she
felt that an unknown friend, almost a confidant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
had arrived. She started as if from an electric
shock. He was not much of a society man.
Timid, ill at ease in mixed assemblies, he did
not care to dance, play, or converse, but preferred
to stay apart in one corner of the room
with some friends; quite indifferent to the
waltzes and quadrilles, but more attentive to
several masterpieces of modern music feelingly
played. The entire evening passed without his
being near her, although he had noticed her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in all that brilliant ball had seen but her. Their
eyes met many times. At last, about two o'clock
in the morning, when the company was less
formal, he ventured to approach her, without
speaking, however. It was she who first spoke
to him, to express a doubt about the conclusion
of his last book.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
<img src="images/illo_094.jpg" width="441" height="399" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Flattered, but still more surprised to learn that
those metaphysical pages had had so young a
reader, and a lady too, the author replied rather
awkwardly that those investigations were somewhat
uninteresting for a woman. She answered
that women, and even young girls, were not exclusively
absorbed in frivolity; that she knew
several who occasionally worked, thought, endeavored,
and studied. She spoke with a good
deal of spirit, defending women against the
contempt of certain scientists of the other sex,
and maintained their intellectual equality. She
had no trouble in winning a cause to which her
listener was by no means hostile.</p>

<p>The new book&mdash;whose success had been immediate
and brilliant, notwithstanding the gravity
of its subject&mdash;had surrounded George
Spero's name with an actual halo of fame, and
the brilliant writer was warmly welcomed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
every drawing-room. The two young people
had exchanged but a few words when they found
themselves the general object of attention, and
were forced to reply to different questions, which
interrupted their interview. One of the most
eminent critics of the day had recently devoted
a long article to the new work, and the subject
of the book became at once the topic of general
conversation. Icléa took no part in it; but she
felt&mdash;and women are not often mistaken&mdash;that
the hero had noticed her, that her thought
was already linked to his by an invisible thread,
and that while he replied to the more or less
common-place questions thrust upon him, his
mind was not wholly on the conversation. This
first little triumph was enough, she cared for
no other; and moreover she had recognized in
his profile both the mysterious silhouette in the
aerial apparition and the young stranger on the
steamer at Christiania.</p>

<p>In that first interview he had not hesitated
to express his enthusiastic admiration for the
marvellous scenery in Norway, and to tell her
about his visit there. She was eager for a word,
some sort of an allusion to the aerial phenomenon
which had made so great an impression upon her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and could not understand his silence in regard to
it. Not having observed the <i>anthelion</i> when she
was reflected upon it, he had not been particularly
surprised at an occurrence which he had already
studied before and under better conditions,&mdash;from
the car of a balloon; and having seen
nothing specially noticeable, had nothing to say
about it. The occurrence at the steamboat landing
too had entirely passed from his memory; so
that although the fair beauty of the young girl
did not seem entirely unfamiliar to him, yet he
had no recollection of having met her before.
As for me, I had recognized her at once. He
talked about the lakes, rivers, fiords, and mountains
of Norway; learned from her that her
mother had died very young from heart-disease,
that her father preferred living in Paris to anywhere
else, and that it was probable she should
not visit her native land except at rare intervals
for the future.</p>

<p>A remarkable identity of ideas and tastes, a
ready and mutual sympathy, a reciprocal respect,
soon made them friends. Brought up and
educated with English ideas, she enjoyed that
independence of mind and freedom of action
which Frenchwomen never know until after marriage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she felt hampered by none of the social
conventionalities which with us are supposed
to protect innocence and virtue. Two friends
of her own age had even come to Paris to finish
their musical education. They were living together
in the very heart of Babylon in perfect
safety, never even suspecting the dangers by
which Paris is said to be beset. The young girl
received George Spero's visits as her father would
have received them himself; and in a few weeks
the congeniality in their tastes and dispositions
had united them in the same studies, the same
researches, often in the very same thoughts.
Almost every afternoon he went, drawn by a
secret attraction, from the Latin quarter along
the borders of the Seine as far as the Trocadéro,
and passed several hours with Icléa either in
the library, on the garden-terrace, or walking
in the wood.</p>

<p>The first impression aroused by the apparition
on the sky had remained in Icléa's mind. She
looked up to the young savant, if not as a god
or hero, at least as a man far superior to his
contemporaries. The perusal of his works
strengthened this feeling and increased it; she
felt more than admiration, she had an actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
veneration for him. When she knew him personally,
the great man did not descend from his
pedestal. She found him so high, so excellent in
his works, his inquiries, his studies, and at the
same time so simple, so sincere, so good-natured,
so indulgent to all, and (seizing any pretext for
hearing him talked about), she was sometimes
forced to listen to such unjust criticisms upon
him from rivals, that she began to have an almost
maternal feeling for him. Does the sentiment
of protecting affection exist in every young
girl's heart? Perhaps. But assuredly she loved
him thus at first. I have already said that the
basis of this thinker's character was somewhat
melancholy,&mdash;that melancholy of the soul of
which Pascal speaks, and which is like homesickness
for heaven. In fact, he was ever seeking
to solve the eternal question, Hamlet's "To
be, or not to be?" Sometimes he would be sad,
downcast. But by a singular contrast, when
his unhappy thoughts had worn themselves out,
so to speak, in vain research, and his exhausted
brain had lost the power of further vibration,
a kind of repose came to him,&mdash;he recovered
his ordinary quiet; the circulation of his red
blood stimulated his organic life; philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
disappeared, leaving him like a simple child,
amused at trifles; and having almost feminine
tastes, delighting in flowers, perfumes, music,
revery, he appeared sometimes astonishingly
light-hearted.</p>

<span class="smaller">"TO BE, OR NOT TO BE?"</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">T</span> was this very phase of his intellectual life
which had drawn the two friends so intimately
together. Happy at being alive, in the
flower of her spring-time, expanding to the light
of life,&mdash;a harp thrilling with all the harmonies
of Nature,&mdash;the beautiful Northern girl still
sometimes dreamed of the fays and elves of her
native clime, of the angels and mysteries of the
Christian religion which had soothed her childhood.
The credulity of her early days had not
obscured her understanding; she thought freely,
and sought sincerely for the truth; while re<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>gretting
perhaps that she no longer believed in
the paradise of the preachers, she felt nevertheless
a strong desire to live forever. Death
seemed to her a cruel injustice. She never
thought of her mother lying on her death-bed
in the ripe beauty of her thirtieth year,&mdash;taken
away to the green and fragrant cemetery, filled
with the songs of birds, while the roses were in
full bloom; crossed off the book of life while
all Nature still sang, still bloomed and shone,&mdash;she
never thought of her mother's pale face,
as I said, without a sudden shudder creeping all
over her from head to foot. No, her mother
was not dead! She would not die at thirty, or
at any time! And he? He die! That sublime
mind to be blotted out by a stoppage of the
heart or breath? No, it was not possible!
Men are mistaken! We shall know some
day!</p>

<p>Then, too, sometimes she thought of these
mysteries under a form rather more æsthetic
and sentimental than scientific; but she thought
of them. All her questionings, her doubts, the
secret object of her conversations, perhaps her
rapidly developed attachment for her friend,&mdash;the
cause of it all was the insatiable thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for knowledge which consumed her soul. She
hoped in him because she had already found in
his writings a solution to the highest problems.
He had taught her to know the universe; and
she found this knowledge more beautiful, more

that life had no object other than the search
for truth, she had felt sure that he would find
it; and her mind clung to and bound itself to
his even more strongly than her heart.</p>

<p>They had lived a common intellectual life in
this way for about three months, almost every
day spending several hours reading original essays,
written in different languages, on science
and philosophy,&mdash;the theory of atoms, molecular
physics, organic chemistry, thermo-dynamics,
and the different sciences whose object is the
knowledge of existence,&mdash;or in discoursing upon
the real or apparent contradictions of hypotheses;
sometimes finding statements and coincidences
most remarkable for their scientific axioms, in
the books of purely literary writers, and occasionally
astonished at the foresight of some
great authors. These readings, investigations,
and comparisons had especially interested them
by the discrimination which their minds were
led to make, as they became more and more enlightened,
between nine tenths of the writers
whose works are absolutely worthless, and half
of the last tenth, whose writings have but
a superficial value. Having thus cleared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
field of literature, they took great delight and
satisfaction in the restricted society of superior
minds. Perhaps mixed with it was a little
feeling of pride.</p>

<p>One day Spero arrived earlier than usual.
"Eureka!" he cried. But correcting himself
quickly, added, "Perhaps."</p>

<p>Leaning against the chimney-piece, where a
bright fire crackled, while his companion looked
at him with her large eyes full of curiosity, he
began to speak with a sort of unconscious solemnity,
as though he were discussing something
with his own mind in the solitude of the woods.</p>

<p>"What we see is only apparent. Reality is
quite different.</p>

<p>"The sun apparently turns about us, rising
every morning, setting at night; the earth
where we are seems to be motionless: but the
contrary is the truth. We live on a whirling
projectile, thrown into space with a speed
seventy-five times as great as that which carries
a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>"Our ears are pleased by a harmonious concert.
Sound does not exist; it is merely an
impression of the senses produced by vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of a certain size and rapidity on the air, which
in themselves are silent. There would be no
sound without the acoustic nerve and the brain.
In reality there is nothing but motion.</p>

<p>"The rainbow spreads its radiant circle; the
rose and corn-flower, dripping with rain, glitter
in the sun; the green meadow, the golden furrow,
diversify the plain with their bright colors.
There are no colors; there is no light,&mdash;there
is nothing but the ether waves, which cause a
vibration of the optic nerve. Appearances are
deceitful. The sun warms and fertilizes; fire
burns. There is no heat, only sensation;
heat, like light, is but one form of motion,&mdash;invisible
but supreme, sovereign motion!</p>

<p>"Take a strong iron beam, like one of those
used so generally in building nowadays. It is
set up in space, ten metres high, between two
walls which support its ends. It is 'solid.'
In the middle of it is placed a weight of one,
two, or ten thousand kilograms; but it does
not even show this enormous weight,&mdash;a level
would hardly find a depression in it. And yet
this beam is composed of particles which do not
touch each other, which are in perpetual vibration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which separate under the influence of heat,
and are drawn together by cold. Tell me, if
you please, in what the solidity of this bar of
iron consists. Its material atoms? Assuredly
not, since they do not touch. That solidity lies
in molecular attraction,&mdash;that is to say, in an
immaterial force.</p>

<p>"Speaking absolutely, solidity does not exist.
Take up a heavy iron cannon-ball: this ball is
composed of invisible molecules which do not
touch each other. The continuity which the
surface seems to have, and the apparent solidity
of the ball are, then, pure illusions. To the
mind which would analyze it, its inner structure
is an eddying swarm of little gnats, like those
darting about in the air on a summer day.
Then suppose we heat this apparently solid
ball: it will melt; heat it more, it will evaporate,&mdash;but
without changing its nature for all
that; gas or liquid, it will still be iron.</p>

<p>"We are in a house. All these walls, these
floors, these carpets, this furniture, the marble
mantelpiece, are also composed of particles
which do not touch each other; and all these
particles which constitute these objects are in
constant motion, circulating around each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"Our body is in the same condition. It is
formed by a perpetual circulation of molecules;
it is a flame which is ceaselessly consumed and
renewed; it is a stream on whose banks one sits
down, expecting to see the same water again, but
the perpetual course of things always brings fresh
water. Each globule of our blood is a world
(and we have five millions per cubic millimetre).
Constantly, without let or hindrance, in our
arteries and veins, in our flesh, in our brain, all
circulates,&mdash;all moves, all hurries along in a
vital whirl as rapid, proportionately, as that of
the heavenly bodies. Molecule by molecule, our
brain, our skull, our eyes, our nerves, our entire
flesh ceaselessly renews itself, and so rapidly
that in a few months our entire body is
reconstituted.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"From estimates founded on molecular attraction
it has been calculated that in a tiny drop
of water taken up on the point of a pin, a drop
invisible to the naked eye, measuring one thousandth
of a cubic millimetre, there are more than
two hundred and twenty-five million molecules.</p>

<p>"In the head of a pin there are not less than
eight sextillions of atoms, or eight thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
millions of millions of millions; and these atoms
are separated from each other by distances greater
than their dimensions, these dimensions being
invisible even to the most powerful microscope.
If one felt inclined to count the number of these
atoms contained in the head of a pin, by detaching
in thought a thousand million of them per
second, it would be necessary to continue the
operation for two hundred and fifty-three thousand
years, in order to finish the enumeration.</p>

<p>"In a drop of water, in the head of a pin,
there are incomparably more atoms than there
are stars in all the sky known to astronomers,
armed with their strongest telescopes.</p>

the stars of the universe in the eternal void?
What upholds that heavy iron beam thrown
between two walls, and upon which several
stories are to be built? What keeps all bodies
in shape? Force.</p>

<p>"The world, beings, and things, all that we
see, is formed of invisible and imponderable
atoms. The universe is a dynamism. God is
the universal soul; <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in eo vivimus, movemur,

"As the soul is force moving the body, the
Infinite Being is force moving the universe.
The purely mechanical theory is incomplete to
an analyst who goes to the bottom of things.
It is true that the human <i>will</i> is weak, in comparison
to cosmic forces; yet by sending a
train from Paris to Marseilles, a ship from Marseilles
to Suez, I freely displace an infinitesimal
portion of the earth's matter, and modify the
moon's course. Blind men of the nineteenth
century, come back to the swan of Mantua:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mens agitat molem</i>.</p>

<p>"If I dissect matter, I find the invisible atom
at the base of everything. Matter disappears,
fades away into smoke. If my eyes had power
enough to see the truth, they would see, through
walls and bodies composed of separate molecules,
atomic swarms. The eyes of the flesh do
not see what is. The mind's eye must see. Do
not rely on the evidence of your senses alone;
there are as many stars over our heads in the
daytime as there are during the night.</p>

<p>"In Nature there is neither astronomy nor
chemistry nor philosophy nor mechanics; those
are subjective methods of observation. There is
but a single unit. The infinitely great is identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

without being great. Time is eternal without
being long. Stars and atoms are one.</p>

<p>"The unity of the universe is constituted of
invisible, imponderable, immaterial force, which
moves atoms. If a single atom should cease to
be moved by force, the universe would stop.
The earth turns round the sun, the sun gravitates
around a sidereal arch, which is itself
capable of motion; the millions, the thousand
millions of suns which people the universe move
much more rapidly than gunpowder projectiles;
these stars which seem to us to be motionless
are suns thrown into the eternal void at the
speed of ten, twenty, thirty millions of kilometres
a day, all rushing towards an unknown
goal,&mdash;suns, planets, earths, satellites, wandering
comets ...; the fixed point, the centre of
gravity sought after by analysts, flies as fast
as it is pursued, and really exists nowhere. The
atoms of which bodies are composed, move relatively
as fast as stars in the sky. Motion regulates
all things, forms all things.</p>

of carbon with hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen,&mdash;it is animate, invisible, immaterial
<i>Force</i>. It is that which groups, directs, and
keeps together the innumerable particles which
compose the exquisite harmony of the living
body.</p>

<p>"Matter and energy have never been seen
separated from each other; the existence of one
implies the existence of the other; they are perhaps
substantially identical.</p>

<p>"If the body should suddenly decay after
death, as it slowly disintegrates and perpetually
renews itself during life, it would matter little.

listens to an apostle, a loved apostle; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
although he had really spoken but for her, he
had not apparently realized her presence,&mdash;she
had been so silent and motionless. She went to
him and took one of his hands in hers. "Oh!"
she cried, "if you have not yet conquered
Truth, she cannot elude

and alluding to
an often-expressed
reservation
of his, "You

"that it is
impossible for
terrestrial man
to attain to the
truth because we
have but five senses, and that a multitude of natural
manifestations are unknown to our minds because
we have no means of reaching them. Just
as sight would be denied us if we were deprived
of the optic nerve, hearing if we had no acoustic
nerve, etc.; just as the vibrations, the exhibitions
of force which pass between the strings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
our organic instrument, without causing those
we have to quiver, are unknown to us. I concede
that, and agree with you that the inhabitants
of certain
worlds
maybe incomparably
more
advanced than
we; but it
seems to me
that although
earthly, you
have found it
out."</p>

<p>"My darling,"
he answered,
sitting
down beside
her on the
wide library
lounge, "it is
very certain
that some of
the strings in our terrestrial harp are missing:
probably a citizen of the Sirius system would
laugh at our pretentions. The smallest piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of magnetized iron is stronger in finding the
magnetic pole than either Newton or Leibnitz,
and the swallow knows the variations of latitude
better than did Christopher Columbus or
Magellan. What did I say just now? That
appearances are deceitful, and that our minds
must see invisible force through matter. That
is perfectly sure. Matter is not what it seems
to be, and no man informed about the progress
of the positive sciences could now pretend
to be a materialist."</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "the cerebral atom, the
principle of human organism, would be immortal,
like all other atoms, if one should admit the
fundamental assertions of chemistry. But it
would differ from the others, possessing a higher
rank, the soul being attached to it. And would
it preserve the consciousness of its existence?
Would the soul be comparable to an electric
substance? Once I saw the lightning go
through a drawing-room and extinguish the
lights; when they were re-lighted, we found that
the gilding had all been taken off the clock, and
that the chased silver candlestick was gilded
in several places. That is a subtle force!"</p>

<p>"Do not draw comparisons; they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
too far from the truth. There is no doubt
that the soul exists, as force does. We can
admit that it and the cerebral atom are one;
that it thus survives the dissolution of the body
we can imagine."</p>

<p>"But what becomes of it? Where does it go?"</p>

<p>"The greater number of souls never even
suspect their own existence. Out of the fourteen
hundred millions of human beings who
people the earth, ninety-nine one hundredths do
not think. Great heavens! what would they
do with immortality? As the molecule of iron
floats in the blood, throbbing in Lamartine's or
Hugo's temple, or is fixed for a time in Cæsar's
sword; as the molecule of hydrogen shines in
the lobby of a theatre, or merges itself into the
drop of water swallowed by a fish in the dusky
depths of the sea, so living atoms sleep which
have never thought. Thinking souls are the inheritance
of the intellectual life. They preserve
humanity's patrimony, and increase it for
the future. Without this immortality of human
souls which are conscious of their existence and
live through the mind, all the history of the
earth would end in nothing, and the whole
creation, that of the most sublime worlds as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
well as that of our mean little planet, would
be a deceptive absurdity, more miserable and
pitiable than the cast of an earthworm. That
has a right to be; but the universe would not
have. Do you imagine that the thousand millions
of worlds attain the splendors of life and
thought, to succeed each other without end in
the sidereal universe, only to give birth to constantly
deceived hopes, and grandeurs which are
perpetually destroyed? It is useless for us to
humble ourselves; we cannot admit that nothing
is the supreme object of perpetual progress,
proved by all the history of Nature. Now, souls
are the seeds of planetary humanities."</p>

<p>"Can they transport themselves from one
world to another?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/illo_118.jpg" width="426" height="268" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Nothing is so difficult to understand as that
of which one is ignorant, nothing more simple
than what one knows. Who is surprised now
to see that the electric telegraph instantly sends
human thought across continents and seas?
Who is surprised to see lunar attraction raise
the waters of the ocean and produce tides?
Who is surprised to see light transmit itself
from one star to another at the rate of three
hundred thousand kilometres per second? Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
thinkers alone could appreciate the grandeur
of these marvels; the vulgar are surprised
at nothing. If some new discovery to-morrow
should enable us to make signals to the inhabitants
of Mars and receive replies from them,
three quarters of mankind would think nothing
of it the day after. Yes, the animating forces
can transport themselves from one world to the
other; not everywhere nor always, to be sure,
and not all of them. There are laws and conditions.
My will, with the help of my muscles,
can raise my arm or throw a stone; if I take a
weight of twenty kilos, it will still raise my
arm; if I want to raise a weight of a thousand
kilos, I can no longer do it. Some minds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
incapable of any activity; others have acquired
transcendent faculties. Mozart at six years of
age surprised all his hearers by the power of
his musical genius, and at eight published his
first two sonatas; while the greatest dramatic
author who ever existed, Shakspeare, had written
nothing worthy of his name until after he
was thirty years old. It is not necessary to
believe that the soul should belong to some
supernatural world. Everything is in Nature.
It is hardly more than a hundred thousand
years since terrestrial humanity evolved itself
from the animal chrysalis. For millions of
years, during the long historic series of the
primary, secondary, and tertiary periods, there
was not a single eye on the earth to see these
grand sights, a single human mind to contemplate
them. Progress has slowly raised the
inferior souls of plants and animals; man is
quite recent on the planet. Nature is in ceaseless
progress, the universe is a perpetual growth,
ascent is the supreme law.</p>

<p>"All worlds," he added, "are not actually
inhabited. Some are at the dawn, others at
twilight. For example, in our solar system,
Mars, Venus, Saturn, and several of his satellites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
seem to be in full vital activity. Jupiter
appears not to have passed its primary period;
the Moon has perhaps no longer any inhabitants.
Our own period is of no more importance in the
general history of the universe than one anthill
in the infinite. Before the existence of the
earth, there had been, from all eternity, worlds
peopled with humanities. When our planet
shall have ceased to live, and the last human
family shall have fallen asleep on the brink of
the last lagoon of the frozen ocean, numberless
suns will still shine in the infinite, there will
still be mornings and evenings, spring-time and
flowers, hopes and joys, other suns, other earths,
other humanities,&mdash;boundless space, peopled
with tombs and cradles. But life, thought,
eternal progress, are the final object of creation.</p>

<p>"The earth is a star's satellite. Now, as well
as in the future, we are citizens of the sky;
whether we know it or not, we are really living
in the stars."</p>

<p>Thus the two friends conversed about the
deep subjects which engrossed their thoughts;
when they were conquering a problem, even if
it were incomplete, they experienced a true happiness
at having taken another step in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
search for the unknown, and could then talk
more quietly about the ordinary things of life.
They were two minds equally eager for knowledge,
imagining in their youthful fervor that
they could isolate themselves from the world,
look down upon human ideas, and in their
celestial flight reach the star of Truth, which
shone above their heads in the depths of the
infinite.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">N</span> their life together, pleasant and intimate
as it was, there was something lacking.
These conversations on the serious topics of
being or non-being, their exchange of ideas on
the analysis of humanity, their inquiries into
the final end of the existence of things, satisfied
their minds sometimes, but not their hearts.
When they had been together for a long time,
talking under the garden trellis which towered
above the picture of the great city, or in the
silent library, the student, the thinker could
not leave his companion; they sat hand in<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hand, mute, attracted and repelled by an irresistible
power. After leaving each other, both
felt a singular, painful void in their breasts, an
indefinable uneasiness, as though some link necessary
for both their lives had been broken;
and each hoped for nothing but the hour of
meeting. He loved her, not for himself, but
for herself, with an almost impersonal affection,
with a feeling of high esteem as well as ardent
love; and by a constantly fought combat with
his desire he had been able to resist it. But
one day, when they were both sitting on the
wide divan in the library, strewn, as usual, with
books and loose leaves, a silence fell upon them,
and it happened that, overcome perhaps by the
weight of his long-continued efforts to resist
so powerful an attraction, the young author's
head insensibly drooped to his companion's
shoulder, and almost at once ... their lips
met....</p>

<p>Oh, unutterable joys of requited love; insatiable
intoxication of the heart transported
with happiness; never-ending delights of the uncurbed
imagination; sweet music of the heart,&mdash;to
what ethereal heights have you not raised the
chosen ones, given up to your supreme felicities!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Suddenly forgetful of this lower world, they fly
on outstretched wings to some enchanted paradise,
lose themselves in celestial depths, and
soar away to the sublime regions of eternal rapture.
The world, with its joys and its sorrows,
no longer exists for them; they live in
light, in fire,&mdash;they are salamanders, ph&oelig;nixes,
freed from all weight, light as flame, burning
themselves out, rising again from their ashes,
always luminous, always ardent, invulnerable,
invincible.</p>

<p>The expansion of their first long-repressed
delights threw the lovers into an ecstatic existence
in which metaphysics and its problems
were for a time forgotten. This lasted six
months. The sweetest but most imperious of
feelings had suddenly absorbed and taken possession
of them, thus completing the insufficient
intellectual satisfactions of the mind. From the
day of the kiss, George Spero not only entirely
disappeared from society, but even ceased to
write; and I lost sight of him myself, notwithstanding
the long and true affection he had professed
for me. Logicians might have been able
to conclude from this that for the first time in
his life he was satisfied that he had found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
solution of the great problem,&mdash;the supreme
object of the existence of beings.</p>

<p>They were living in this "selfishness for
two" which, while moving mankind from our
optic centre, diminishes its defects and makes it
appear more beautiful. Satisfied by their mutual
affection, everything in nature and humanity
sang a perpetual hymn of happiness and
love. Often in the evening they walked along
the banks of the Seine, dreamily contemplating
the effects of light and shade which make the
sky of Paris so exquisite at twilight, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
silhouettes of towers and buildings are thrown
out against the luminous background in the
west. Piles of rose-colored and purple clouds,
illuminated by the distant reflection of the sea
over which the vanished sun is still shining,
give our skies a character of their own, not
like that of Naples, bathed in the west by the
Mediterranean mirror, but surpassing Venice
perhaps, whose illumination is pale and eastern.
It might chance that, their steps having
led them to the old island of the Cité, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
would stroll along the river bank, passing in
sight of Notre Dame and the old Châtelet, whose
dark outlines might still be seen against the
dimly lighted sky. Sometimes, often indeed,
enticed by the brilliance of the setting sun and
by the fresh green of the country, they went
along the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quais</i>, out beyond the ramparts of the
great city, and strayed as far as the solitudes of
Boulogne or Billancourt, shut in between the
dusky hills of Meudon and Saint-Cloud. They
were contemplating Nature; they forgot the
noisy city lost behind them; and walking with
the same step, forming but one being, they
received the same impressions, thought the same
thoughts, and by their silence spoke the same
language. The stream flowed on at their feet,
the noises of the day were dying away, the
first stars were peeping out. Icléa liked to tell
George their names as they appeared.</p>

on which the first warm breezes, forerunners
of spring, greet us. Orion's brilliant stars,
the dazzling Sirius, the Twins, Castor and Pollux
glitter in the immense sky; the Pleiades
sink towards the western horizon; but Arcturus
and Boötes, shepherd of the celestial flocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
return, and a few hours later white and resplendent
Vega rises on the eastern horizon,
soon followed by the Milky Way. Arcturus with
its golden rays is always the first star to be recognized,
from its piercing brilliancy and from its
position in the prolongation of the tail of the
Great Bear. Sometimes the lunar crescent was
hanging in the western sky, and the young girl
gazed admiringly, like Ruth by Boaz' side, at
"that golden sickle in the field of stars."</p>

<p>The stars surround the earth, the earth is in
the sky. Spero and his companion realized this,
and perhaps no other couple on any other celestial
earth lived on more intimate terms than
they with the sky and infinity.</p>

<p>And yet by degrees, perhaps without noticing
it himself, the young philosopher was gradually
taking up again by shattered fragments his interrupted
studies; analyzing subjects now with
a deep feeling of optimism which he had never
known before, in spite of his natural kindliness;
excluding cruel conclusions because they seemed
to him to be due to an insufficient knowledge of
causes, looking at the panoramas of Nature and
of humanity in a new light. She too had taken
up, at least partially, the studies which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
begun in common with him; but a new feeling
filled her soul, and her mind had not the same
freedom for intellectual work. Absorbed in this
constant affection for a being whom she had
wholly won, she saw only through him, acted
only by him. In quiet evening hours, when she
went to the piano and played a sonata by
Chopin, which she was astonished to find she
had not understood until she was in love, or to
accompany her pure rich voice while singing the
Norwegian <i xml:lang="no" lang="no">lieder</i> by Grieg or Bull, or our own
Gounod's melodies, it seemed to her, unconsciously
perhaps, that her lover was the only
listener capable of appreciating these inspirations
of the heart. What delicious hours he
spent, stretched on a divan in that spacious
library in the house at Passy, sometimes idly
following the capricious rings of smoke from a
Turkish cigarette, while she gave herself up to
fanciful memories, singing the sweet <i>Saetergientens
Sondag</i> of her native land, the serenade
from "Don Juan," Lamartine's "Lake," or else
when running her skilful fingers over the keys
she sent the melodious dream of Boccherini's
minuet floating into the air.</p>

<p>Spring had come. May had brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
opening fêtes at the Universal Exhibition of
which we spoke at the beginning of this story,
and the great trees in the garden at Passy
shaded the Eden of the loving couple. Icléa's
father, who had suddenly been called to Tunis,
returned with a collection of Arabian arms for
his museum at Christiania. He intended to go
back to Norway very soon, and it had been
agreed between the young Norwegian girl and
her lover that the marriage should take place
in her native land on the anniversary of the
mysterious apparition.</p>

<p>Their love was, from its very nature, very far
removed from all those common-place unions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
founded, some on gross sensual pleasure, others
on motives of interest more or less disguised,
which represent the greater part of human love.
Their cultivated minds kept them isolated in
the loftier regions of thought; their delicacy of
feeling kept them in an ideal atmosphere where
all material burdens were forgotten; the extreme
impressibility of their nerves, the exquisite
refinement of all their sensations, brought
them delights whose enjoyment seemed to have
no end. If there is love in other worlds, it can
be no deeper or more exquisite feeling. To a
physiologist they would have been the living
witnesses of the fact that, contrary to ordinary
opinion, all enjoyment comes from the brain,
the intensity of sensation corresponding to the
psychic sensibility of the being.</p>

</div>

<p>Paris was for them, not a city, not a world,
but the theatre of human history. They lived
the past centuries over again. The old quarters
which had not yet been ruined by modern
changes,&mdash;the Cité, with Notre Dame, Saint-Julien
le Pauvre, whose walls still recall Chilpéric
and Frédégonde; the old houses where Albert
le Grand, Petrarch, Dante, Abelard, had lived;
the old University, anterior to the Sorbonne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and belonging to the same vanished centuries;
the cloister of Saint-Merry with its sombre little
paths, the abbey of Saint-Martin, Clovis' tower
on the mountain, Saint-Geneviève, Saint-Germain-des-Prés,
a relic of the Merovingians, Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois,
whose bell sounded the
tocsin, the Sainte-Chapelle at Louis IX.'s palace,
all memorials of French history, were the
object of their pilgrimages. They were alone in
crowds, looking into the past and seeing what
very few people know how to see.</p>

<p>And so the immense city spoke its language
of other days,&mdash;either when, lost amid the monsters,
griffins, pillars, and capitals, the arabesques
of the tower and galleries of Notre Dame, they
saw the human hive go to sleep at their feet in
the evening dusk, or, when rising higher still,
they tried from the top of the Panthéon to
restore the old outlines of Paris and its gradual
development from the Roman emperors who
lived in the Baths, to Philip Augustus and his
successors.</p>

<p>The spring sunshine, the blooming lilacs, the
joyous May mornings, full of bird-songs and nervous
exhilaration, often drew them at random
away from Paris into the meadows and woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The hours flew by like a breath of wind, the
day had passed like a thought, and the night
prolonged the divine
dream of love.
In the swiftly
revolving world of
Jupiter, where the
days and nights are
twice as rapid as
they are here, and
do not even last
ten hours, lovers do
not find the time
fade away any
more quickly. The
measure of time is
in ourselves.</p>

<p>They were sitting one evening
on the roof of the old tower at
the Château de Chevreuse;
there was no railing, and they
were close together in the
centre, from whence one can
look down over the unobstructed surrounding
landscape. The warm air from the valley, impregnated
with wild perfumes from the neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
woods, rose to where they sat; the
warbler was still singing, and the nightingale
in the growing shadows was trying over his
melodious hymn to the stars. The sun had just
set in a blaze of crimson and gold, and the west
alone was still illuminated by a glowing radiance.
Everything seemed to be asleep on Nature's
broad bosom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/illo_134.jpg" width="428" height="345" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Icléa was a little pale; but in the glow of the
western sky her skin was so clear, so delicate,
so ideal that the light seemed to penetrate it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and illuminate it from within. Her eyes were
misty with soft languor, and her little, childlike
mouth was lightly parted; she seemed lost in
contemplation of the sunset light. Leaning on
Spero's breast, her arms twined about his neck,
she was sinking into a revery when a shooting-star
crossed the sky just over the tower. She
started with a little feeling of superstition.</p>

<p>The most brilliant stars were already sparkling
in the heavenly depths. Arcturus, a brilliant
golden yellow, was very high, almost at the
zenith; Vega, a pure white light, had already
risen towards the west; in the north, Capella;
in the west, Castor, Pollux, and Procyon. The
seven stars of the Great Bear, Regulus, Spica
Virginis, were also discernible. Noiselessly, one
by one, the stars came out to punctuate the
heavens. The north star showed the only
motionless spot in the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>The moon was rising, its reddish disk somewhat
diminished from being on the wane. Mars
was shining between Pollux and Regulus in the
southwest, Saturn in the southeast. Twilight
was slowly yielding its place to the mysterious
reign of night.</p>

<p>"Does it not seem to you," she asked, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
all these stars are like eyes looking down
at us?"</p>

<p>"Celestial eyes, like yours. What can they
see on earth more beautiful than you&mdash;and
our love?"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;" she added.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'and yet,'&mdash;the world, family, society,
custom, moral laws, and all that. I understand
your thought. We have forgotten all these
things to obey attraction alone,&mdash;like the sun,
like all those stars, like the warbling nightingale,
like all Nature. Very soon we shall give
those social customs the part which belongs to
them, and can openly proclaim our love. Shall
we be any happier for that? Is it possible
to be any happier than we are at this very
moment?"</p>

<p>"I am yours," she replied, "I do not exist
for myself. I am swallowed up in your light,
your love, in your happiness, and I care for
nothing, nothing more. No. I was thinking of
those stars, of those eyes looking down at us, and
wondering where all the human eyes are which
have watched them for millions of years as we
do to-night. Where are all the hearts that have
beaten as our heart beats now? Where are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the souls who have lost themselves in endless
kisses in the mysterious vanished nights?"</p>

<p>"They all exist, nothing can be destroyed.
We associate heaven and earth, and we are right.
In all the ages, with all peoples, among all
beliefs, mankind has always asked the secret of
its destiny of the starry heavens. That was
one kind of divination. The Earth is a star of
heaven, like Mars and Saturn, which we see
yonder, earths of the sky, lighted by the same
sun as we are, and like all these stars, which are
distant suns. Thought translates what man
has believed ever since it existed. All eyes have
sought the answer to the great enigma in the
skies, and Urania has replied to them since the
early days of mythology."</p>

<p>The night was coming on. The moon, slowly
rising in the eastern sky, was shedding her radiance
through the atmosphere, insensibly displacing
the twilight; and in the city at their feet,
below the thickets and ruins, a few lights were
already beginning to appear here and there. The
two had risen, and were standing in the centre
of the tower roof, closely clasped together. She
was beautiful, framed in the aureole of her hair,
whose curls floated over her shoulders; little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
puffs of spring-like air, fragrant with perfume
of violets, gillyflowers, lilacs, and May roses
were rising from the neighboring gardens. Solitude
and silence were about them. Their lips
united in a long kiss,&mdash;the hundredth at least
of that beautiful day of spring. She was still
dreaming. A fugitive smile suddenly lighted up
her face, then faded away like a passing cloud.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! A worldly, foolish thought;
a little silly&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"But what was it?" he asked, taking her
again in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was only wondering if people had
mouths in those other worlds; because, you
know&mdash;a kiss&mdash;lips&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so the hours passed away,&mdash;days, weeks,
months, in a perfect union of all their thoughts,
all their feelings and impressions. The June
sun was already shining at its solstice, and the
time to leave for Icléa's home had come. At
the appointed time she left with her father for
Christiania, and Spero followed them a few days
later. It was the young savant's intention to
stay in Norway until autumn, and continue the
studies on the aurora borealis he had begun the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
year before,&mdash;observations which were especially
interesting to him, and which he had
had scarcely time to begin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/illo_139.jpg" width="413" height="301" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This visit to Norway was the prolongation of
a happy dream. The fair Northern girl cast an
aureole of perpetual winsomeness about him
which would perhaps have made him still forget
the attractions of science if she herself had not
had, as we have seen, an insatiable taste for
study. The experiments which the indefatigable
seeker had undertaken on atmospheric electricity
interested her as much as they did him.
She too wanted to know about those mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
flames in the aurora borealis which palpitate at
night in high atmospheres; and as his series of
investigations led him to desire a balloon ascension,
in order to reach and surprise the phenomenon
at its source, she also experienced the same
wish. He tried to dissuade her from it, those
aeronautic expeditions not being free from
danger. But the very idea of sharing a peril
with him would have been enough to make her
deaf to her loved one's entreaties. After long
hesitation Spero decided to take her with him,
and prepared for an ascension from the University
of Christiania on the first night of the
aurora borealis.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE AURORA BOREALIS.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> disturbances of the magnetic needle
had announced the aurora's presence even
before the sun went down, and the inflation of
the balloon with pure hydrogen gas was begun
while the sky showed in the magnetic
North that coloring of golden green which is
always the sure indication of an aurora bore<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>alis.
The preparations were ended in a couple
of hours. The atmosphere, entirely free from
all clouds, was perfectly limpid, the stars
twinkled in the bosom of a sky profoundly dark
and without a moon; but towards the North a
soft light shone in an arc above a black segment,
throwing into the upper atmosphere slight
flushes of a pale greenish rose color, symbolizing
the palpitations of an unknown life. Icléa's
father, who was watching the inflation of the
balloon, had no suspicion that his daughter was
going; but at the last moment she stepped into
the car as if to inspect it. Spero gave the signal,
and the balloon rose slowly, majestically,
over the city of Christiania, which, lighted by
thousands of lamps, appeared under the eyes
of the travellers rising through the air, to
diminish in size as it disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illo_143.jpg" width="425" height="475" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Soon the balloon, taking an oblique ascent,
hovered over the darkened landscape, and the
paling lights also disappeared. The noises of
the city died away at the same time into profound
silence: it was the silence of the upper
heights which enveloped the air-ship now.
Icléa was impressed by this extraordinary stillness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
perhaps, above all, by the novelty of the
situation, and clung to her rash lover's side.
They mounted rapidly. The aurora borealis
appeared to descend, and spread itself out under
the stars, like an undulating drapery of fleecy
gold and purple, overrun with electric flashes.
Spero watched his instruments, and by the help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of a little crystal globe filled with glow-worms,
wrote down the indications corresponding to
the heights attained. The balloon went up
steadily. What a delight to the investigator!
In a few moments he would soar to the crest
of the aurora borealis; he would find an
answer to the question about the aurora's
height which had been asked in vain by so
many philosophers, and especially by his beloved
masters, the two great "psychologists and
philosophers," Oersted and Ampère!</p>

<p>Icléa's emotion had calmed itself. "Were
you afraid?" asked her lover. "The balloon is
safe; you need fear no accident,&mdash;everything
has been provided for. We will go down
in an hour; there is not a breath of wind stirring
on the earth."</p>

<p>"No," she said, while the celestial light
threw over her a roseate and transparent illumination;
"but it is so strange, so beautiful, so
divine. It is grand for little me! I shuddered
for a moment. It seems to me that I love you
more than ever!" and throwing her arms about
his neck, she kissed him in a long, passionate,
clinging embrace.</p>

<p>The solitary balloon was moving silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
through the aerial heights, a spheroid of transparent
gas enclosed in its silken envelope,
whose vertical gores, joining each other at the
valve on the top, could be seen from the car;
the lower part of the balloon being open for the
dilation of the gas.</p>

<p>The dusky brightness that falls from the
stars, of which Corneille speaks, would have
been sufficient without the gleams from the
aurora borealis to enable them to distinguish
the whole of the aerial skiff. The car was hung
to the net which enveloped the silken vessel by
strong ropes tied to the basket-work and interlaced
under the feet of the aeronauts. The
silence was impressively solemn; the beating of
their hearts could have been heard. They were
sailing at a height of five thousand metres, with
an unaccustomed gravity; the upper wind was
carrying them along without the faintest breath
being felt in the car, for the balloon floated in
the moving air like a simple bubble,&mdash;motionless,
except as the current carried it along. Our
travellers&mdash;sole inhabitants of these lofty regions,
in full enjoyment of the exquisite elation
which aeronauts know when once they have
breathed that rare and sublimated atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&mdash;looked
down upon the realms below, forgetful
of all earthly cares and associations, in the
silence of their vast isolation. But they appreciated
and enjoyed their unique situation
more than any of those who had preceded them,
for they added to the pleasures of an aerial voyage
the rapture of their own happiness. They
spoke in low tones, as if afraid of being overheard
by the angels, and of seeing the magic
charm dissolved which held them so near to
heaven.... Sometimes sudden flashes came
to them,&mdash;gleams from the aurora borealis;
then darkness, deeper and more unfathomable
than before, reigned again.</p>

<p>They were floating thus in their starry dream
when a quick, shrill noise, like that of a new
whistle, sounded in their ears. They listened,
leaned far out over the car, and listened again.
The noise did not come from the earth. Was it
an electrical blast from the aurora borealis?
Was it the hiss of some magnetic storm in the
upper air? Lightning coming from the depths
of space flashed about them and disappeared.
They listened breathlessly again. The sound
was quite close to them.... It was the gas
escaping from the balloon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Either the valve had partly opened of itself,
or they had pressed upon the connecting rope
while incautiously moving about in the car;
at all events, the gas was escaping.</p>

<p>Spero at once detected the cause of the disquieting
noise, and it terrified him, for it was impossible
to close the valve again. He examined
the barometer, which had begun slowly to rise,
while the balloon was beginning to descend. The
fall, slow at first, but inevitable, would increase
in mathematical proportion. Trying to fathom
the abyss below them, he saw the flames of the
aurora borealis reflected in the water of an immense
lake. The balloon was now descending
with great rapidity, and was not more than
three thousand metres from the ground. Outwardly
calm, but fully conscious of the certain
and impending peril, the unfortunate aeronaut
threw out one after the other the two sacks left
for ballast, then the maps, the instruments, the
anchor, and emptied the car; but this lightening
of the weight was not enough, and served
only to slacken momentarily their accelerated
speed. The balloon was now descending, or
rather falling, at a tremendous rate, and was
but a few hundred metres above the lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Strong wind-currents blew up and down and
whistled in their ears.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/illo_148.jpg" width="334" height="576" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The balloon
twisted about
itself, as if
whirled by a
waterspout.
George Spero
felt a sudden
and passionate
embrace, followed
by a long
kiss upon his
lips. "My master,
my god,
my all! I love
you," she cried;
and thrusting
aside two of
the ropes, she
leaped into the
empty air. The
unballasted balloon
shot up
again like an arrow. Spero was saved.</p>

<p>Icléa's body made a dull, strange, and frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
sound in the midnight stillness as it fell into
the deep waters of the lake. Wild with grief
and despair, Spero felt his hair bristling with
horror. He opened his eyes wide, but saw
nothing. Carried up by the balloon to a height
of more than a thousand metres, he clung to the
valve-rope, hoping to fall again towards the
scene of Icléa's catastrophe; but the rope would
not work. He fumbled and hunted, but without
avail. In the midst of all he felt under his
hand his loved one's veil, where it had caught
on one of the ropes,&mdash;a thin little veil, still
fresh with perfume, and filled with the memories
of his lovely companion. He stared at the
ropes, thinking he could find the imprint of
her little clinging hands, and putting his own
where Icléa's had been an instant before, he
threw himself out of the car. His foot caught
in a rope for a second, but he had strength
enough to disengage it, and fell whirling into
space.</p>

<p>The crew of a fishing-boat that had witnessed
the closing scenes of the drama crowded all sail
towards the spot in the lake into which the
young girl had fallen, and succeeded in finding
and rescuing her. She was not dead; but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
care lavished upon her could not prevent a fever
from setting in and making her its prey.</p>

<p>In the morning the fishermen reached a little
harbor on the borders of the lake, and carried
her to their humble cot; but she did not regain
consciousness. "George!" she cried, opening
her eyes, "George!" and that was all. The
next day she heard the village bell tolling
a funeral knell. "George!" she repeated,
"George!" His body was found in a terribly
mangled condition a short distance from the
shore. His fall was more than a thousand
metres. It had begun over the lake; but the
body, retaining the horizontal impetus given by
the moving balloon, had not fallen vertically,
it had descended obliquely, as if slipping down
a rope following the course of the balloon; and
like a mass thrown from the sky, had fallen into
a meadow near the shore of the lake, making a
deep indentation in the soil, and rebounding more
than a metre from the place where it fell. His
very bones were crushed into powder, and the
brain protruded through the forehead. His grave
had hardly been closed before they were obliged
to dig another beside it for Icléa, who died murmuring
in a feeble voice, "George! George!"</p>

day the dwellers on the shores of beautiful Lake

I had forgotten,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> or at least lost sight of them,
when quite recently, at a hypnotic séance in
Nancy, where I had stopped for a few days on
my way to the Vosges, I was induced to question a
"subject" by whose assistance the experimental
savants of the Académie Stanislas had obtained
some of those really startling results with which
the scientific Press has surprised us for a few
years past. I do not remember how, but it
happened that my conversation with him turned
on the planet Mars. After describing to me a
country situated on the shores of a sea known
to astronomers under the name of Kepler's
Ocean, and a solitary island lying in the bosom
of this sea; after telling me about the picturesque
landscapes and reddish vegetation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
adorned the shores, the wave-washed cliffs, and
the sandy beaches where the billows break and
die away,&mdash;the subject, who was very sensitive,
suddenly grew pale, and raised his hand
to his head; his eyes closed, his eyebrows contracted;
he seemed desirous of grasping some
fugitive idea which obstinately eluded him.
"<i>See!</i>" said Dr. B., standing before him with
irresistible command; "see! I wish it."</p>

<p>"You have friends there," he said to me.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that," I said, laughing;
"I have done enough to deserve them."</p>

<p>"Two friends," he went on, "who are talking
about you now, this very minute."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Persons who know me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"They have known you here."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Here,&mdash;on the earth!"</p>

<p>"How long ago was it?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Have they lived on Mars long?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Are they young?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are lovers, who adore each other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Then the loved image of my lamented friends
rose distinctly in my mind; but I had no sooner
seen them than the subject exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes! it is they!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I see,&mdash;they are the same souls, same
colors."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the 'same colors'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the souls are suffused with light."</p>

<p>A few instants afterwards he added, "And
yet there is a difference."</p>

<p>Then he was silent, his forehead frowning in
his effort to find out. But his face regained
all its calmness and serenity as he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has become she, the woman; she is now
the man,&mdash;and they love each other more than
ever."</p>

<p>As if he did not quite understand what he
had said himself, he seemed to be seeking for
some explanation,&mdash;made painful efforts, judging
from the contraction of the muscles in his
face, and fell into a sort of cataleptic fit, from
which Dr. B. speedily relieved him; but the
lucid interval had fled, not to return.</p>

<p>In ending, I leave this last fact with the
reader just as it happened, without comment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Had the subject, according to the hypothesis
now admitted by many hypnotists, been under
the influence of my own thought when the professor
ordered him to answer me? Or, being
independent, had he really "freed" himself,
and had he <i>seen</i> beyond our sphere? I cannot
undertake to decide. Perhaps it will appear in
the course of this story.</p>

<p>And yet I will acknowledge in all sincerity
that the resurrection of my friend and his
adored companion on the world of Mars,&mdash;a
neighboring abode to ours, and so remarkably
like this one we inhabit, only older, doubtless
more advanced on the road of progress,&mdash;may
appear to a thinker's eyes the logical and natural
continuation of their earthly existence, so
quickly broken off.</p>

<p>Doubtless Spero was right in declaring that
matter is not what it seems to be, and that appearances
are deceitful; that the real is the invisible;
that animate force is indestructible; that
in the absolute, the infinitely great is identical
with the infinitely small; that celestial space
is not impassable; and that souls are the seeds
of planetary humanities. Who knows but that
the philosophy of dynamism may one day reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the religion of the future to the apostles of astronomy?
Does not Urania bear the torch
without which every problem is insoluble, without
which all Nature would remain to us in
impenetrable obscurity? Heaven must explain
the earth, the infinite must explain the soul
and its immaterial faculties.</p>

<p>The unknown of to-day is the truth of to-morrow.</p>

<p>The following pages will perhaps enable us
to form something of an idea of the mysterious
link which binds the transitory to the eternal,
the visible to the invisible, earth to heaven.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> magnetic séance at Nancy had left a
strong impression on my mind. I often
thought of my departed friend and his investigations
in the unexplored domains of nature
and life, of his sincere and original analytical
researches on the mysterious problem of immortality;
but I could not think of him now without
associating him with the idea of a possible
reincarnation in the planet Mars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
This idea seemed to me to be bold, rash,
purely imaginary if you like, but not absurd.
The distance from here to Mars is equal to
zero for the transmission of attraction; it is
almost insignificant for that of light, since a few
minutes are enough for a luminous undulation
to travel millions of leagues. I thought of the
telegraph, the telephone, and the phonograph;
of the influence a hypnotizer's will has on his
subject many kilometres distant; and I wondered
if some marvellous advance in science
might not suddenly throw a celestial bridge
between our world and others of its kind in
infinity.</p>

<p>For several evenings I could not observe Mars
through the telescope without my attention
being diverted by many strange fancies. Still,
the planet was very beautiful, as it was during
all the spring of 1888. Extensive inundations
had taken place upon one of its continents,
upon Libye, as astronomers had observed before
in 1882, and under various circumstances.
It was discovered that its meteorology and
climatology are not the same as ours, and that
the waters which cover about half of the planet's
surface are subject to strange displacements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and periodical variations, of which terrestrial
geography can give no idea. The snow at the
boreal pole had greatly diminished,&mdash;which
proves that the summer on that hemisphere had
been quite hot, although less elevated than that
of the southern hemisphere. Besides, there had
been very few clouds over Mars during the
whole series of our observations. But it will
be hardly credible that it was not these astronomical
facts, however important they might be,
and the base of all our conjectures, which most
interested me,&mdash;it was what the hypnotized
man had told me of George and Icléa; the fantastic
ideas flitting through my brain prevented
me from making a truly scientific observation.
I persistently wondered if communication could
not exist between two beings very far removed
from each other, and even between the living
and the dead; and each time I told myself
that such a question was of itself unscientific,
and showed a positive spirit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</div>

<p>Yet, after all, what is what we call "science"?
What is not "scientific" in Nature?
Where are the limits of positive study? Is the
carcase of a bird really a more scientific thing
than its lustrous, colored plumage and its song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with its subtle tones? Is the skeleton of a
pretty woman more worthy of admiration than
her structure of flesh and her living form? Is
not the analysis of the mind's emotions "scientific"?
Is it not scientific to try to find
out whether the mind can see to a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and in what manner? And then, how much
reason is there in this strange vanity, that we
imagine that science has told us all; that we
know all there is to know; that our five
senses are sufficient to appreciate the nature
of the universe? From what we can make
out among the forces acting about us,&mdash;attraction,
heat, light, electricity,&mdash;does it follow
that there may not be other forces which
escape us, because we have no senses to perceive
them? It is not this hypothesis which
is absurd, it is the simplicity of pedants. We
smile at the ideas of the astronomers, philosophers,
physicians, and theologians of three
centuries ago; three centuries hence, will not
our successors laugh in their turn at the affirmations
of those who pretend to know everything
now?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 394px;">

<p>The physicians to whom fifteen years ago I
communicated some magnetic phenomena observed
by myself during some experiments,
all confidently denied the reality of the facts.
I met one of them recently at the Institute.
"Oh!" said he, not without a certain wit,
"then it was magnetism; now it is hypnotism,
and we are studying it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Moral. Do not deny anything as a foregone
conclusion. Let us study and discover; the explanation
will come later.</p>

<p>I was in this
frame of mind,
pacing up and
down my library,
when my
eyes chanced to
fall on a pretty
copy of Cicero
which I had
not noticed for
some time. I
took up a volume
of it,
opened it mechanically
at
the first page I
came to, and
read the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two friends arrive at Megara and take
separate lodgings; one of them has hardly
fallen asleep before he sees his travelling companion
beside him, telling him sorrowfully that his host has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>formed a plan to assassinate him, and begging him to
come to his assistance as quickly as possible. The
other awakes; but satisfied that he has had a bad
dream, loses no time in going to sleep again. His
friend appears to him again, and conjures him to
hasten, because the murderers are coming to his room.
More puzzled, he is astonished at the persistency of
this dream, and is on the point of going to his friend;
but reason and fatigue triumph, and he goes to bed
again. Then his friend comes to
him for the third
time, pale, bleeding,
disfigured.
'Wretch,' said he
to him, 'you did
not come when I implored
you; it is all over now.
Avenge me. At sunrise
you will meet a cart loaded
with manure at the city gate: stop it, and
order it to be unloaded; you will find my body hidden
in the middle. Give me an honest burial, and
pursue my murderers.' So great a tenacity, such minute
details, admitted of no further delay or hesitation; the
friend rises, hurries to the gate mentioned, finds the
wagon there, stops the driver, who is frightened; and
soon after the search begins, the body of his friend is
found."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figright" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/illo_167.jpg" width="369" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This story seemed to come expressly to
strengthen my opinion in regard to the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
quantities in the scientific problem. Doubtless
hypotheses are not lacking in reply to the point
in question. It may be said that perhaps the
circumstance never happened as Cicero tells it,
that it has been amplified and exaggerated; that
two friends coming to a strange city may fear
an accident, that fearing for a friend's life after
the fatigue of a journey, in the middle of the
quiet night, one might chance to dream that he
is the victim of an assassin. As to the episode
of the cart, the travellers may have seen one
standing in their host's court-yard, and the
principle of the association of ideas comes in
to bring it into the dream. Yes, these explanatory
hypotheses may be made; but they
are only hypotheses. To admit that there
had really been any communication between
the dead man and the living one is also an
hypothesis.</p>

<p>Are facts of this kind very rare? It seems
not. I remember, among others, a story told
me by an old friend of my boyish days, Jean
Best, who, with my eminent friend Édouard
Charton, founded the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Magasin Pittoresque</i> in
1883, and died a few years ago. He was a
grave, cold, methodical man, a skilful typographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
engraver, and a careful business man.
Every one who knew him knows how little
nervous he was by temperament, and how foreign
to his mind were things of the imagination.
Well, the following incident happened
to him when he was a
child between five and
six years old.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/illo_169.jpg" width="282" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was at Toul, his
native place. He was
lying in his little bed
one beautiful evening,
but was not asleep,
when he saw his
mother come into his
chamber, cross it, and
go into the adjoining
drawing-room, whose
door was open, and
where his father was
playing cards with a
friend. Now, his mother was ill at Pau at that
time. He at once rose from his bed and ran
to the drawing-room after his mother, where
he looked for her in vain. His father scolded
him somewhat impatiently, and sent him back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to bed again, assuring him that he had been
dreaming.</p>

<p>Then the child, thinking that he must have
been dreaming, tried to go to sleep again. But
some time afterwards, lying with his eyes open,
he distinctly saw his mother pass him for the
second time; only now he hurried to her and
kissed her, and she at once disappeared. He
did not want to go to bed afterwards, and
remained in the drawing-room, where his father
continued to play cards. His mother died at
Pau the same day at that very hour.</p>

<p>I have this circumstance from M. Best himself,
who remembered it clearly. How explain
it? It may be said that, knowing his mother
was ill, the child often thought of her, and had
an hallucination which happened to coincide
with his mother's death. That is possible. But
it may be thought, too, that there was some
sympathetic link between the mother and child,
and at that solemn moment the mother's soul
may really have been in communication with
her child. How? one may ask. We know
nothing about it. But what we do not know,
is to what we know in the proportion of the
ocean to a drop of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<i>Hallucinations!</i> That is easily said. How
many medical works have been written upon
this subject! Everybody knows that of Brierre
de Boismont. Among the numberless incidents
which it relates, let us cite the two following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Observation 84. When King James came to England
at the time of the London plague, being at Sir
Robert Cotton's house in the country with old Camden,
he saw, in a dream, his oldest son, who was still a child
living in London, with a bleeding cross on his forehead,
as if he had been wounded by a sword. Frightened at
this apparition, the king began to pray; in the morning
he went to Camden's chamber and told him the
events of the night; the latter reassured the monarch,
telling him he had nothing to torment himself about.
That very day the king received a letter from his wife
announcing the death of his son, who had died from the
plague. When the child appeared to his father, he had
the height and proportions of a grown man.</p>

<p>"Observation 87. Mlle. R., a person of excellent
judgment, religious, but not a bigot, lived before her
marriage at her uncle's house, D., the celebrated physician
and a member of the Institute. She was away
from her mother, who was attacked by violent illness
in the country. One night this young person dreamed
that she saw her, pale, disfigured, very near death, and
showing deep grief at not having her children with her,
one of whom, the curate of a parish in Paris, had emigrated
to Spain, the other being in Paris. Soon she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>heard herself called by her christian name several times;
in her dream she saw the persons who were with her
mother, thinking she called her little granddaughter,
who had the same name, go into the next room for her,
when a sign from the sick woman told them it was not
she, but her daughter who lived in Paris, whom she
wanted to see. Her face showed the grief she felt at
the daughter's absence; suddenly her features changed,
the paleness of death spread over her face, and she fell
back lifeless on her bed.</p>

<p>"The next morning Mlle. R. seemed very sad to D.,
who begged to know the cause of her grief. She told
him all the particulars of the dream which had so
greatly distressed her. D., finding her in that frame of
mind, pressed her to his heart, acknowledging that the
news was only too true, that her mother had just died;
he did not enter into further particulars.</p>

<p>"A few months afterwards Mlle. R., profiting by her
uncle's absence to put in order his papers, which, like
many other savants, he disliked to have touched, found
a letter to her uncle relating the circumstances of her
mother's death. What was her surprise to read all the
particulars of her dream!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Hallucination! Fortuitous coincidence. Is
that a satisfactory explanation? At all events,
it is an explanation which explains nothing
at all.</p>

<p>A host of ignorant persons, of all ages and
trades, clerks, merchants or deputies, sceptics by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
temperament or habit, simply declare that they
do not believe these stories, that there is nothing
true about them. That also is not a very
good solution of them. Minds accustomed to
study cannot content themselves with so trifling
a denial. A fact is a fact; we cannot refuse to
admit it, even when we cannot in the present
state of our knowledge explain it.</p>

<p>Of course medical annals acknowledge that
there is really more than one kind of hallucination,
and that certain nervous organizations
are their dupes. But there is a wide gulf between
that and concluding that all psycho-biological
phenomena are hallucinations.</p>

<p>The scientific spirit of our century rightly
seeks to free all these facts from the deceptive
fogs of supernaturalism, inasmuch as nothing
is supernatural, and Nature, whose kingdom is
infinite, embraces everything. During the last
few years a special scientific society has been
organized in England for the study of these
phenomena,&mdash;the Society for Psychical Research.
It has at its head some of the most
illustrious savants on the other side of the
Channel, and has already sent out important
publications. These phenomena of sight at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
distance are classed under the general title of
Telepathy (<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">&#964;&#942;&#955;&#949;</span>, <i>far</i>, <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">&#960;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>sensation</i>). Rigorous
inquiries are made to verify their testimony.
Its variety is very great. Let us look through
one of these collections<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> together for a moment,
and take out a few of the documents which are
duly and scientifically established.</p>

<p>In the following recently observed case, the
observer was as wide awake as you and I are
at this moment. It is about a certain Mr.
Robert Bee, who lives at Wigan, England. Here
is the curious revelation, written by the observer
himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 18th of December, 1873, my wife and I
went to visit my wife's family at Southport, leaving
my parents to all appearance in perfect health. The
next afternoon we were strolling on the beach, when
I became so depressed that it was impossible for me
to interest myself in anything whatever, so that we
soon returned to the house.</p>

<p>"All at once my wife showed signs of great uneasiness,
and said she was going to her mother's room for a
few moments. A minute afterwards I rose from my
armchair and went into the drawing-room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>"A lady in walking costume came towards me from
an adjacent sleeping-room. I did not notice her features,
because her face was turned away from me; still,
I spoke to her, and greeted her at once, but I do not
remember now what I said.</p>

<p>"At the same time, while she was passing before me,
my wife was coming from her mother's chamber, and
walked right over the place where I saw the lady, without
seeming to notice her. I said at once, in great
surprise, 'Who is that lady whom you just met?'
'I met no one,' replied my wife, still more astonished
than I was. 'What!' I replied, 'do you mean to tell
me that you did not see a lady this very minute who
passed by just where you are now? She probably came
from your mother's room, and must be now in the
vestibule.'</p>

<p>"'It is impossible,' she said; 'there is positively no
one in the house at this moment but my mother and
ourselves.'</p>

<p>"Sure enough. No strange lady had been there,
and the search which we immediately began was without
result.</p>

<p>"It was then ten minutes to eight o'clock. The next
morning a telegram informed us of my mother's sudden
death from heart-disease at exactly that hour. She was
then in the street, and dressed precisely like the unknown
lady who had passed in front of me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is the observer's story. The inquiries
made by the Society for Psychical Research
have proved its absolute authenticity and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
agreement of the witnesses. It is as positive
a fact as a meteorological, astronomical, philosophical,
or chemical observation. How can it
be explained? Coincidence, you will say. Can
a strict scientific criticism be satisfied with this
word?</p>

<p>Still another case.</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Wingfield, living at Belle-Isle
en Terre (Côtes-du-Nord), writes that on the
25th of March, 1880, having gone to bed rather
late, after reading a part of the evening, he
dreamed that his brother, living in the county
of Essex, in England, was with him; but instead
of answering a question asked him, merely
shook his head, rose from his chair, and went
away. The impression was so strong that the
narrator sprang from his bed half asleep, awaking
as his foot touched the floor, and called
his brother. Three days later he received
news that his brother had been killed by a
fall from his horse the same day, March 25th,
1880, in the evening, about half-past eight
o'clock, a few hours before the dream just
reported.</p>

<p>An inquiry proved that the date of this death
was exact, and that the author of this narrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had written his dream in a diary at the very
date of the event, and not afterwards.</p>

<p>Still another case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. S. and Mr. L., both employed in a Government
office, had been intimate friends for eight years. Monday,
19th March, 1883, L. had an attack of indigestion at
his office. He went to a druggist's, where he was given
some medicine, and was told that his liver was affected.
The following Thursday he was no better; Saturday of
that same week he was still absent from the office.</p>

<p>"On Saturday evening, March 24th, S. was at home
with a headache; he told his wife that he was too
warm, which he had not been before for two months;
then, after making this remark, he went to bed, and
shortly after he saw his friend L. standing before him,
dressed as usual. S. noticed even this particular about
L.'s clothes, that he had a black band on his hat, and
that his coat was unbuttoned; he also had a cane in
his hand. L. looked directly at S. and passed on. S.
then remembered the sentence in the book of Job, 'A
spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood
up.'</p>

<p>"At that moment he felt a chill run all over his
body, and felt the hair rise on his head. Then he
asked his wife,'What time is it?' She replied,'Ten
minutes of nine.' 'I asked you,' he said, 'because L. is
dead; I have just seen him.' She tried to persuade
him that it was a pure illusion; but he insisted, in the
most solemn manner, that nothing could induce him to
change his opinion."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
This is the story as told by Mr. S. He did
not learn of his friend's death until three o'clock
on Sunday. L. had died on Saturday evening
at about ten minutes of nine.</p>

<p>Agrippa d'Aubigné's historical account of an
occurrence at the time of the Cardinal of Lorraine's
death is somewhat like this story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The king being at Avignon on December 23d, 1574,
Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, died there. The queen
(Catherine de Médicis) had retired to bed earlier than
usual, having at her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coucher</i>, among other persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>of note, the king of Navarre, the archbishop of Lyons,
the ladies de Retz, de Lignerolles, and de Saunes, two
of whom have confirmed this report. As she was hurrying
to finish her good-nights, she threw herself back
on her bed with a start, put her hands over her face
with a loud cry, calling to those about her for help,
pointing to the cardinal at the foot of the bed, who,
she said, was holding out his hand to her. She cried
out several times, 'M. le Cardinal, I have nothing to do
with you.' At the same time the king of Navarre sent
one of his gentlemen to the cardinal's house, who reported
that he had died at that very minute."</p></blockquote>

<p>In his book on "Posthumous Humanity," published
in 1882, Adolphe d'Assier guarantees the
authenticity of the following statement, which
was reported by a lady of St. Gaudens as having
happened to herself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was before my marriage," she said, "and I slept
with my elder sister. One night we had just put out
the light and gone to bed. The fire was still burning
enough to dimly light the room. Glancing at the fireplace,
to my great surprise I saw a priest seated before
the fire warming himself. He was a stout man, and
had the form and features of an uncle of ours, a priest
who lived in the suburbs. I at once spoke to my sister.
The latter looked at the fireplace and saw the
same apparition. She also recognized our uncle the
priest. An indescribable fright took possession of us,
and we both cried 'help' as loud as we could. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>father, who was sleeping in an adjoining room, aroused
by our cries, rose in great haste, and soon came in with
a lighted candle in his hand. The phantom had disappeared;
we no longer saw any one in the chamber. The
next day we learned by letter that our uncle the priest
had died the previous evening."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another fact is reported by the same disciple
of Auguste Comte, and sent by him while living
in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>It was in 1858. In the French colony of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
city, people were still talking about a singular
apparition which had taken place there a few
years before. An Alsatian family, consisting of
a husband, wife, and little girl, still almost a
baby, sailed for Rio de Janeiro, where they were
to join some compatriots living in that city. The
passage was very long, the wife was taken ill,
and lacking proper care and nourishment, did
not live to reach there. The day she died she
fell into a swoon, remained in that state for
some time, and when she recovered her senses,
said to her husband, who was watching by her
side, "I die happy, for now I am easy about the
fate of our child. I have just come from Rio de
Janeiro. I found our friend Fritz the carpenter's
house and street; he was standing at the door.
I showed him our little girl; I feel sure that on
your arrival he will recognize and take care of
her." That very day, at the same hour, Fritz
the Alsatian carpenter, of whom I have just
spoken, was standing at the door of the house
where he lived in Rio de Janeiro, when he thought
he saw one of his compatriots going along the
street with a little girl in her arms. She
looked at him entreatingly, and seemed to
show him the child she was carrying. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
face, notwithstanding its emaciation, reminded
him of Latta, the wife of his friend and fellow-countryman
Schmidt. Her expression, the singularity
of her step, which seemed more like
a vision than reality, struck Fritz; and wanting
to be sure that he was not the victim of an
illusion, he called one of his men who was working
in the shop, and who was also an Alsatian
from the same locality.</p>

<p>"Look," said he; "do you not see a woman
going down the street, holding a child in her
arms, and should you not say that it is Latta,
our friend Schmidt's wife?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say; I do not see her very distinctly,"
replied the workman.</p>

<p>Fritz said no more; but the different circumstances
of this real or imaginary apparition
fixed themselves firmly in his mind, especially
the day and hour. Some time after that,
Schmidt, his compatriot, arrived, carrying a
little girl in his arms. Latta's visit then came
into Fritz's mind; and before Schmidt had
spoken a word he said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know all, my poor friend: your wife
died during the passage. Before she died,
she came and showed me her little girl, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I might take care of her. Here is the date
and hour."</p>

<p>It was really the day and hour noted by
Schmidt on board the boat.</p>

<p>In his work on the Phenomena of Magic,
published in 1864, Gougenot des Mousseaux reports
the following incident, which he certifies
as absolutely authentic:-</p>

<p>Sir Robert Bruce, belonging to the illustrious
Scotch family of that name, was mate of a vessel.
One day, when sailing near Newfoundland,
and while busy with his calculations, he thought
he saw the captain seated at his desk, but looked
at him attentively, and noticed that it was a
stranger, whose cold, fixed look surprised him.
He went on deck; the captain noticed his surprise,
and asked him what it meant.</p>

<p>"Who is at your desk?" asked Bruce.</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is some one there. Is it a
stranger; and how did he come there?"</p>

<p>"You are either dreaming or joking."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Come down and see for yourself."</p>

<p>They go down to the cabin, but there is no
one at the desk. The ship is thoroughly searched,
but no stranger is found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
"And yet the man I saw was writing on your
slate; the writing must be there still," said he
to the captain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/illo_184.jpg" width="462" height="512" alt="" />
</div>

<p>They looked at the slate; it bore these words:
"Steer to the northwest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
"This must be your writing, or some one's
else on board the ship."</p>

<p>"No; I did not write it."</p>

<p>Every one was told to write the same sentence,
and no handwriting resembled that on the slate.
"Very well," said the captain; "we will obey
these instructions and steer the ship to the
northwest; the wind is right, and will admit
of our trying the experiment."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/illo_185.jpg" width="421" height="337" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Three hours later, the watch perceived an iceberg,
and near it a vessel from Quebec, headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for Liverpool, dismantled and covered with
people. They were brought off by boats of
Bruce's vessel.</p>

<p>As one of the men was climbing up the side
of the rescuing vessel, Bruce started, and drew
back in great agitation. He recognized the
stranger whom he had seen tracing the words
on the slate. He reported the strange incident
to the captain.</p>

<p>"Will you write 'Steer to the northwest' on
this slate?" asked the captain, turning to the
new-comer, and offering the side which bore no
writing.</p>

<p>The stranger complied with his request, and
wrote the desired words.</p>

<p>"Will you acknowledge that to be your ordinary
handwriting?" asked the captain, struck
with the similarity of the two sentences.</p>

<p>"Of course; how can you doubt it? You
saw me write it yourself."</p>

<p>As a reply, the captain turned the slate over,
and the stranger was amazed to see his own
writing on both sides.</p>

<p>"Did you dream of writing on that slate?"
said the Quebec captain to the man who had
just been writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"No,&mdash;at least I have no remembrance of
doing so."</p>

<p>"What was that passenger doing at noon?"
asks the rescuer of his brother captain.</p>

<p>"The passenger was very tired, and had fallen
into a sound sleep, as near as I remember, a
little before twelve o'clock. An hour or more
later he awoke, and said to me, 'Captain, we
shall be saved this very day;' adding, 'I
dreamed that I was on board a vessel coming
to our relief.' He described the ship and its
rigging, and we were very much surprised, when
you headed for us, to recognize the exactness of
the description."</p>

<p>After a while the passenger said, "It is very
strange, but somehow this ship seems quite
familiar to me, and yet I was never on it
before."</p>

<p>Baron Dupotet, in his article on "Animal
Magnetism," reports the following fact, published
in 1814 by the celebrated Jung Stiling,
who had it from the observer himself, Baron de
Sulza, chamberlain to the king of Sweden.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/illo_188.jpg" width="369" height="567" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He was going home one night in summer
about twelve o'clock, an hour at which it is still
light enough in Sweden to read the finest print.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
"As I reached the family estate," he said, "my
father came to the entrance of the park to meet
me; he was dressed
as usual, and carried
a cane which my
brother had carved.
I greeted him,
and we talked
together for a
long time. We
went into the
house and up
to his bedroom
door together.
On going into
the chamber I
saw my father
there, undressed,
when the
apparition instantly
faded
away. A little
while afterwards
my father awoke and
looked at me inquiringly. 'My dear Edward,'
said he, 'God be praised that I see you safe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
well! I was greatly distressed about you in my
dream. I thought that you had fallen into the
water and were in danger of drowning.' Now
on that very day," added the baron, "I had
been on the river with some friends crab-fishing,
and had come very near being dragged down by
the current. I told my father that I had seen
his double at the park gate, and that we had
had a long talk together. He told me that he
had often had similar experiences."</p>

<p>In these various stories are seen spontaneous
apparitions and appearances which were provoked,
so to speak, by the will. Can mental
suggestion go so far as that? The authors of
the book mentioned above, "Phantasms of the
Living," reply affirmatively by seven well-attested
examples, of which I will present one to the
attention of my readers. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Rev. C. Godfrey, living in Eastbourne, in the
county of Sussex, having read an account of a premeditated
apparition, was so struck thereby that he determined
to attempt it himself. On the fifteenth of
November, 1886, about eleven o'clock, he concentrated
the whole power of his imagination and all the strength
of will of which he was master, upon the idea of appearing
to a lady, a friend of his, by standing at the foot of
her bed. The effort lasted about eight minutes, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
which Mr. Godfrey felt very much fatigued, and went to
sleep. The next day the lady who had been the subject
of the experiment came of her own accord to tell Mr.
Godfrey of what she had seen. When asked to make a
memorandum, she did so in these words: 'Last night
I awoke with a start, feeling that some one had
entered my room. I heard, too, a noise which I supposed
to be the birds in the ivy outside my window.
I then experienced a sort of uneasiness, a
vague desire to leave my
room and go down to the
lower floor. This
feeling became so
strong that at last
I rose, intending
to take something
to quiet myself.
Going up to my
room again, I
met Mr. Godfrey
standing under the
great window which
lights the staircase. He was dressed as I am accustomed
to seeing him, and I noticed that he was looking
at something very intently. He stood there motionless
while I held up the lamp and looked at him
in astonishment. This lasted three or four seconds,
after which I continued my way upstairs. He disappeared.
I was not frightened, but very much agitated,
and could not go to sleep again.' Mr. Godfrey thought,
very sensibly, that the experiment which he had tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>would have much more importance if it were repeated.
A second attempt failed, but the third was successful.
Of course the lady upon whom he operated was not
apprised of his intention any more than on the first occasion.
'Last night,' she writes, 'Tuesday, December 7th,
I retired to bed at half-past ten, and was soon asleep.
Suddenly I heard a voice, which said, "Wake up," and
I felt a hand touch the left side of my head. [Mr. Godfrey's
intention this time was to make her feel his
presence by voice and touch.] In an instant I was
thoroughly awake. There was a curious noise, like a
jews-harp, in the chamber. I felt, too, a cold breath,
which seemed to envelop me. My heart began to beat
violently, and I distinctly saw a figure leaning over me.
The only light in the room came from a lamp outside,
making a long stream of light over the toilet-table;
this was darkened by the figure. I turned quickly, and
it seemed as if the hand fell from my head to the pillow
beside me. The figure was bent over me, and I felt it
rest against the edge of the bed. I saw the arm on the
pillow all the time. I could see the profile of the face
but dimly, as if through a haze; it might have been
about a minute and a half. The figure had slightly
pushed back the curtain, but I noticed this morning
that it hung as usual. There is no doubt that the
figure was Mr. Godfrey's. I recognized him by the
turn of the shoulders and the shape of the face. All
the time that he was there, a current of cold air blew
through the room as if the two windows had been
open.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>These are <i>facts</i>!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
In the present condition of our knowledge
it would be absolutely foolhardy to seek to explain
them; our psychology is not yet far
enough advanced. There are a great many
things which we are forced to admit, without
the power to explain them in any way. To
deny what we cannot explain would be pure
folly. Could any one explain the world's system
a thousand years ago? Even now, can we
explain attraction? But science moves, and its
progress will be endless.</p>

<p>Do we know the whole extent of the human
faculties? The thinker cannot for a moment
doubt that there may be forces in Nature still
unknown to us,&mdash;as, for example, electricity was
less than a century ago,&mdash;or that there may be
other beings in the universe, endowed with other
senses and faculties. But is terrestrial man
entirely known to us? It does not seem so.
There are facts whose reality we are forced to
admit, with no power whatever to explain
them.</p>

<p>Swedenborg's life offers three of this nature.
Let us put aside for a moment planetary and
sidereal visions, which appear more subjective
than objective. We will remark, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that Swedenborg was a savant of the first order
in geology, mineralogy, and crystallography; a
member of the Academy of Sciences of Upsala,
of Stockholm, and of St. Petersburg; and we
will content ourselves with recalling the three
following facts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/illo_193.jpg" width="459" height="442" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The 19th of July, 1759, this philosopher
landed at Gothenburg on his return from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
journey to England, and went to dine with
a certain William Costel, where there was quite
a large company. At six o' clock in the evening
Swedenborg, who had gone out, came back to
the drawing-room pale and anxious; he said a
great fire had at that moment broken out at
Stockholm at the Südermoln, in the street in
which he lived, and that the fire was spreading
rapidly towards his house. He went out again
and returned, lamenting that a friend's house
had just been reduced to ashes, and that his
own was in the greatest danger. At eight
o'clock, after being out again, he said joyfully,
"Thanks be to God, the fire has been extinguished
at the third house from mine!"</p>

<p>The news of this spread throughout the city,
which was all the more excited because the
governor gave it attention, and many people
were anxious for their property or friends. Two
days afterwards the royal messenger brought
a report of the fire from Stockholm; there was
no disagreement between his account and that
which Swedenborg had given. The fire had
been extinguished at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>This anecdote was written by the celebrated
Emmanuel Kant, who had desired to make an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
inquiry into the facts, and who adds, "What
can be alleged against the authenticity of this
occurrence?"</p>

<p>Now, Gothenburg is two hundred kilometres
from Stockholm. Swedenborg was then in his
seventy-second year.</p>

<p>Here is the second fact:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1761 Madame de Marteville, widow of a
minister from Holland to Stockholm, received
a demand for the sum of twenty-five thousand
Dutch florins (ten thousand dollars), from one
of her husband's creditors whom she knew her
husband had paid, and a second payment of
which would greatly embarrass, almost ruin her.
It was impossible to find the receipt. She went
to see Swedenborg, and a week later she saw
her husband in a dream; he showed her the
piece of furniture in which the receipt had been
placed, together with a hairpin set with twenty
diamonds, which she also believed to be lost.
"It was at two o'clock in the morning. Greatly
elated, she rose, and found everything at the
place indicated. Going back to bed, she slept
until nine o'clock. About eleven o'clock, M.
de Swedenborg was announced. He told her
that he saw M. de Marteville's spirit the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
before, and that he informed him that he was
going to his widow."</p>

<p>And now for the third fact.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/illo_196.jpg" width="457" height="320" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the month of February, 1772, being in
London, Swedenborg sent a note to the Rev.
John Wesley (founder of the Wesleyan sect),
telling him that he should be very glad to make
his acquaintance. The zealous preacher received
the note just as he was setting out on a journey,
and replied that he should profit by the gracious
permission to visit him, on his return, which
would be in about six months. Swedenborg
answered him "that in that case they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
never see each other in this world, as the 29th
of the next month was to be the day of his
death."</p>

<p>Swedenborg really died on the date mentioned
by himself more than a month beforehand.</p>

<p>These are three facts whose authenticity it
is impossible to doubt, but which in our present
condition of knowledge no one would be able
to explain.</p>

<p>We might multiply these <i>authentic</i> accounts
indefinitely. Facts analogous to those already
mentioned of communications from a distance,
whether at the moment of death or in the
normal condition of life, are not so rare&mdash;without,
however, being very frequent&mdash;but
that every one of our readers may have heard
such cited, or perhaps have observed them himself
in more than one instance. Besides, experiments
made in the realms of magnetism
show also that under certain ascertained psychological
conditions an experimenter can act
upon his subject not only at the distance of
a few metres, but of several kilometres, and
even of more than a hundred kilometres, according
to the sensitiveness of the subject, as well
as to the intensity of the magnetizer's will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Moreover, space is not what we suppose. The
distance from Paris to London is great for a
walker, and was even insurmountable before
the invention of boats; it is nothing for electricity.
The distance from the Earth to the
Moon is great for our present modes of locomotion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">it is nothing for attraction. In fact,</span><br />
from an absolute point of view, the space which
separates us from Sirius is not a greater part
of infinity than the distance from Paris to
Versailles, or from your left eye to your right.</p>

<p>There is more yet; the separation which
seems to us to exist between the Earth and the
Moon, or between the Earth and Mars, or even
between the Earth and Sirius, is only an illusion
due to the insufficiency of our perceptions. The
Moon acts constantly upon the Earth, and moves
it perpetually. The attraction of Mars for our
planet is equally acute, and we in our turn disturb
Mars in its course in submitting to the influence
of the Moon. We act upon the Sun itself,
and make it move as if we touched it. By
virtue of attraction, the Moon causes the Earth
to turn every month around their common centre
of gravity,&mdash;a point which travels one thousand
seven hundred kilometres below the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the globe. The Earth causes the Sun to turn
annually around their common centre of gravity,
situated four hundred and fifty-six kilometres
from the solar centre; all the worlds act upon
each other perpetually, so that there is no isolation,
no real separation, between them. Instead
of being a void separating the worlds
from one another, space is rather a connecting
link. Now, if attraction thus establishes a real,
perpetual, active, and indisputable communication
between the Earth and its sisters in
immensity, as proved by the precision of astronomical
observations, we do not see by what
right pretended positivists can declare that no
communication can be possible between two
beings, more or less distant from each other,
either on the Earth or in two different worlds.</p>

<p>Cannot two brains that vibrate in unison at
a distance of many kilometres be moved by the
same psychic force? Cannot the emotion which
starts from a brain reach a brain vibrating at
no matter what distance, just as sound crosses
a room, making the strings of a piano or violin
vibrate?</p>

<p>Do not forget that our brains are composed
of molecules which do not touch, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
are in constant vibration. And why speak of
brains? Cannot thought, will, psychic force,
whatever its nature may be, act on a being to
whom it is attached by the sympathetic and
indissoluble ties of intellectual relationship?
Do not the palpitations of a heart suddenly
transmit themselves to the heart which beats
in unison with ours? Are we to admit in the
cases of apparitions noted above that the mind
of the dead has really assumed a corporeal form
when near the observer? In the greater part
of the cases this hypothesis does not seem necessary.
In our dreams we think we see persons
who are not before our closed eyes at all. We
see them perfectly, as well as in broad daylight;
we speak to them, converse with them. Surely
it is neither our retina nor our optic nerve which
sees them, any more than our ear hears them.
Our cerebral cells alone are concerned in it.</p>

<p>Certain apparitions may be objective, exterior,
and substantial; others may be subjective,&mdash;in
that case the being who manifests himself would
act from a distance on the being who sees, and
this influence on his brain would determine
the interior vision which appears exterior, as
in dreams, but may be purely subjective and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
interior. Just as a thought, a memory, may
arouse an image in our minds which may be
very distinct and very vivid, just so one intelligence
acting upon another may make an
image appear in him which will for a moment
give him the illusion of reality. It is not the
retina which is affected by a positive reality, it
is the optic thalami of the brain which are
excited. In what way? The present state of
our physiological and psychological knowledge
does not yet teach us that.</p>

<p>Such are the most rational inductions which
it seems possible to derive from the phenomena
to which we have just been giving our attention,&mdash;unexplained,
but very old phenomena; for the
histories of all peoples, from the highest antiquity,
have preserved examples of it which it would
be very difficult to deny or efface. But it will
be asked, ought we, can we, admit in our age
of experimental methods and positive science
that a dying or even a dead man can communicate
with any one? What is a dead man?</p>

<p>A human being dies every second on the
whole terrestrial globe; that is, eighty-six thousand
four hundred per day, about thirty-one millions
per year, or more than three milliards per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
century. In ten centuries more than thirty
milliards of corpses have been committed to the
earth and given back to general circulation under
the form of various products,&mdash;water, gas, etc.
If we keep an account of the diminution of human
population as we count up the historic ages,
we find that for ten thousand years, <i>at least two
hundred milliards of human bodies have been formed
from the earth and from the atmosphere by respiration
and nourishment, and have returned to it</i>. Molecules
of oxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid, and nitrogen,
which have constituted these bodies, have
enriched the earth and been given back to atmospheric
circulation.</p>

<p>Yes, the Earth we inhabit is now formed
partly of the milliards of brains which have
thought, the milliards of organisms who have
lived. We walk over the remains of our ancestors
as our descendants will walk over ours.
The brows of thinkers; eyes which have looked,
smiled, and wept; mouths which have sung of
love, rosy lips, and marble bosoms; mothers' flesh
and blood; the arms of toilers; the muscles of
men, good and bad,&mdash;all who have lived, all who
have thought, lie in the same earth. It would be
difficult now to take a single step on the planet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
without walking on the remains of the dead;
it would be difficult to breathe without inhaling
the breath of the dead. The constructive elements
of the body draw upon Nature and are
returned to Nature, and each one of us bears
in himself atoms which have formerly belonged
to other bodies.</p>

<p>Ah, well! Do you think that can be all of
humanity? Do you think it may not have left
something nobler, grander, and more spiritual?
Does each of us give the universe, when we
breathe our last, nothing but sixty or eighty
kilos of flesh and bone which will disintegrate
and return to the elements? Does not the soul
which animates us endure by the same right as
each molecule of oxygen or nitrogen or iron?
And all the souls that have lived, do they not
still exist?</p>

<p>We have no right to affirm that man is composed
solely of material elements, and that
the thinking faculty is only one property of
the organization. On the contrary, we have the
strongest reasons for admitting that the soul
is an individual entity, that it is that which
governs the molecules to organize the living
form of the human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
What becomes of the invisible and intangible
molecules which have composed our body during
life? They will belong to new bodies. What
becomes of the equally invisible and intangible
souls? It may be thought that they also reincarnate
themselves in new organisms, each in
accordance with its nature, its faculties, and its
destiny.</p>

<p>The soul belongs to the psychic world.
Doubtless there is on the Earth an innumerable
quantity of souls, still heavy and coarse, barely
freed from matter, and incapable of conceiving
intellectual realities. But there are others who
live in study, in contemplation, in the culture of
the psychic or spiritual world. Those cannot
remain imprisoned on the Earth, and their destiny
is to live the Uranian life.</p>

<p>The Uranian soul, even during its terrestrial
incarnations, lives in the world of the absolute
and divine. It knows that, though dwelling on
the Earth, it is really in heaven, and that our
planet is a star of heaven.</p>

<p>What is the inner nature of the soul? What
are its ways of manifestation? When does its
memory become permanent, and maintain with
certainty a conscious identity? Under what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
variety of forms and substances can it live?
What extent of space can it overcome? What
is the order of intellectual relationship which
exists among the different planets of the same
system? What is the germinating force which
sows the world with seed? When can we put
ourselves in communication with the neighboring
earths? When shall we penetrate the
profound secret of destiny? Mystery and ignorance
to-day. <i>But the unknown of yesterday
is the truth of to-morrow.</i></p>

It is an historic and scientific fact, and absolutely
incontestable, that in all ages, among all
peoples, and under the most diverse religious
manifestations, the idea of immortality rests
invulnerable at the base of human consciousness.
Education has given it a thousand forms, but
did not invent it. It exists of itself. Every
human being coming into the world brings with
him, under a form more or less vague, this inner
feeling, this desire, this hope.</p>

<span class="smaller">ITER EXTATICUM C&OElig;LESTE.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> hours and days that I devoted to the
study of these psychological and telepathical
questions did not prevent my observing
Mars through the telescope, and taking geographical
drawings of it, every time that our
atmosphere, so often cloudy, would permit.
Besides, it may be realized that while in the
study of Nature and in science all questions are
related to each other, yet that astronomy and
psychology are most closely united to each other,
since the psychic universe has the material world<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for its habitat, while astronomy has for its object
the study of the regions of eternal life, and we
could form no idea of these regions if we did
not know them astronomically. In fact, whether
we know it or not, we are living now, at this
moment, in heavenly regions, and all beings,
whatever they may be, are eternally citizens of
heaven. It was not without a secret divination
of things that antiquity made Urania the Muse
of all the sciences.</p>

<p>My mind had been occupied with the planet
Mars for a long time, when one day, in a solitary
ramble on the edge of a wood, after several
hours of July heat, I seated myself at the foot
of a clump of oak-trees, and was not long in
dropping off to sleep.</p>

<p>The heat was overpowering, the landscape
silent, the Seine seemed quiet as a canal at the
bottom of the valley. I was strangely surprised
on waking up after a few minutes' nap at no
longer recognizing the landscape nor the trees,
nor the river flowing at the foot of the hill,
nor the undulating meadows which stretched
far away to the distant horizon. The setting
sun was smaller than we are accustomed to see
it, the air thrilled with harmonious sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
unknown to Earth, and insects as large as birds
were fluttering about on the leafless trees, which
were covered with gigantic red flowers. Astonishment
made me spring up with so energetic
a bound that I found myself on my feet feeling
singularly light and buoyant. I had taken
but a few steps before it seemed to me that
more than half the weight of my body had
evaporated during my sleep. This inner sensation
struck me even more forcibly than the
metamorphosis of Nature spread out before
me.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes or senses.
Besides, my eyes were not at all the same. I
did not hear in the same way, and I realized at
once that my organization had developed several
new senses quite different from those of our
terrestrial body, especially a magnetic sense, by
which one being can communicate with another
without the necessity of translating thoughts
audibly by words. This sense reminds one of
the magnetic needle, which, from a cellar in the
Paris Observatory, starts and shivers when an
aurora borealis appears in Siberia, or when an
electric explosion breaks out in the Sun.</p>

<p>The orb of day had just sunk in a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lake, and the rosy gleams of twilight were hovering
far down the sky, like a last dream of light.
Two moons were beginning to shed their rays
at different heights: the first, a crescent, hung
over the lake in whose bosom the Sun had disappeared;
the second, in its first quarter, was
much higher, and towards the east. They were
very small, and but distantly resembled the immense
torch of our earthly nights. It seemed
as if they shed their bright but feeble rays
regretfully. I looked from one to the other in
utter bewilderment. Perhaps the strangest
thing in all this strange spectacle was that the
western moon, which was about three times as
large as its companion in the east, although five
times smaller than our terrestrial moon, travelled
through the sky with a motion very easy
to follow with the eye, and seemed to speed
quickly from right to left to join its celestial
sister in the west.</p>

<p>A third moon, or rather a brilliant star, could
also be seen in the last beams of the setting Sun,
which were dying away. Smaller than the
smallest of the satellites, it showed no appreciable
disk, but its light was dazzling. It looked
out from the evening sky as Venus in her most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
brilliant season beams in our own heavens, when
the "shepherd's star" reigns like a queen over
balmy evenings in spring, and weaves the fabric
of happy dreams.</p>

<p>The more brilliant stars were already lighting
up the sky. I recognized Arcturus with its golden
rays, Vega so white and pure, the seven stars
of the Septentrion, and several of the zodiacal
constellations. The evening star, the new vesper,
was shining in the constellation of the Fishes.
After having studied its position in the heavens
for a few moments, and finding out by the constellations
where I was myself; after examining
the two satellites and reflecting on the lightness
of my own body,&mdash;I was convinced that I was
on the planet Mars, and that the beautiful evening
star was&mdash;the Earth!</p>

<p>My eyes rested on it with that feeling of
mournful love which thrills the fibres of our
hearts when our thoughts fly away to a beloved
object from whom we are separated by cruel
distance; for a long time I looked at that fatherland
where so many different feelings meet and
jostle each other, and I thought,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a pity it is that the numberless human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
beings living on that little habitation do not
know where they are! That little Earth
is most beautiful thus lighted
up by the Sun, with its microscopic moon which
looks like a speck beside it. Borne through
the invisible by the divine laws of attraction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a floating atom in the harmony of the skies,
it fills its place and hovers overhead like an
angelic island! But its inhabitants are unaware
of it! Singular humanity! They find
the Earth too wide, so divide themselves up into
flocks, and spend their time shooting one another.
In that angelic isle there are as many
soldiers as there are male inhabitants; they are
all in arms against one another, and think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
glorious to change the names of countries and
the colors of flags, when it would have been so
simple a matter to live peacefully. War is the
favorite occupation of its nations, and the primordial
education of the people. Aside from
that, they spend their existence in adoring
matter. They do not appreciate intellectual
worth, are indifferent to the most wonderful
problems of creation, and live an objectless
life! What a pity! A citizen of Paris who
had never heard the city's name mentioned, nor
that of France, would not be more of a stranger
than they in their own country. Ah! if they
could but see the Earth from here! How delighted
they would be to return to it, and how
transformed all their ideas would be, both general
and individual! Then they would at least
know the land they live in; it would be a beginning,&mdash;they
would study progressively the
sublime truths about it, instead of vegetating
under a horizonless fog, and after a while they
would live the true life, the intellectual life."</p>

<p>"What honor he pays it! One would think
he had left friends in that prison yonder!"</p>

<p>I had not spoken, but I distinctly heard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sentence, which seemed like a reply to my inward
conversation. Two of the dwellers upon
Mars were looking at and had understood me,
by virtue of that sixth sense of magnetic perception
to which I before alluded. I was somewhat
confused, and, I must confess, deeply wounded,
by this apostrophe. "After all," I thought, "I
love the Earth; it is my country, and I am
patriotic." My two neighbors both began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered one of them, with unexpected
good-nature, "you are patriotic; any
one might know that you have just come from
the Earth."</p>

<p>And the elder added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let your compatriots alone. They will never
be any more intelligent or less blind than they
are now. They have been there eighty thousand
years already, and you yourself acknowledge
that they are not yet capable of thinking. It
is really very absurd of you to look at the
Earth with such sorrowful eyes. It is too
foolish."</p>

<p>Dear reader, have you not, in your journey
through the world, sometimes met men who
were puffed up with imperturbable pride, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
who thought themselves sincerely and unquestionably
above all the rest of the world? When
these proud personages find themselves face to
face with anything superior, they are instantly
hostile to it, they cannot endure it. Very well.
In the preceding dithyramb (of which you have
had but a very poor translation), I felt myself
greatly superior to earthly humanity, since I
felt pity for it, and invoked for it better days.
But when these two inhabitants of Mars pitied
me, and I thought I discovered in them a cold
superiority to myself, I was for a moment like
these foolish, proud people. My blood gave one
bound, and, restraining myself by a remnant
of French politeness, I opened my mouth to
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all, gentlemen, the inhabitants of the
Earth are not as stupid as you appear to think,
but are worth perhaps more than you."</p>

<p>Unfortunately they did not give me time to
begin my sentence, inasmuch as they had understood
it all while it was being formed by the
vibration of the substance of the brain.</p>

<p>"Permit me to remark at once," said the
younger, "that your planet is an absolute failure,
in consequence of an occurrence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
happened about ten million years ago. It was
at the time of the primary period of the earthly
genesis. There were plants already, and very
fine plants too; the first animals were beginning
to appear in the depths of the sea and along the
shores,&mdash;mollusks that were headless, deaf, mute,
and without sex. You know that respiration
is all a tree requires for its entire nourishment,
and that your most robust oaks, your most
gigantic cedars, have never eaten anything,
and that that has not prevented their growth.
They are nourished solely by respiration. Misfortune,
Fatality, had willed that a drop of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thicker than the surrounding medium should
pass through one of the mollusks. Perhaps he
liked it. That was the first digestive tube,
which was to exert so baleful an effect on the
entire animal kingdom, and later on mankind
itself. The first
murderer was
the mollusk who
ate. Here we
do not eat, have
never eaten,
and never shall
eat. Creation is
developing itself
gradually,
peacefully, and
nobly, as it began.
Organisms
are nourished;
or, to express
it differently,
renew their molecules by a simple respiration,
like your terrestrial trees, each leaf of which is
a little stomach. In your precious country you
can live a single day only on condition of killing.
With you, the law of life is the law of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Here, the idea of killing even a bird has never
occurred to any one.</p>

<p>"You are all more or less butchers. Your
hands are stained with blood, your stomachs
are gorged with food. How can you expect to
have wholesome, pure, elevated ideas,&mdash;I will
even say (excuse my frankness) clean ideas,&mdash;with
such coarse organisms? What souls could
live in such bodies? Reflect a moment, and do
not soothe yourself any more with blind illusions,
too ideal for such a world."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, interrupting him, "do
you deny us the possibility of having clean
ideas? Do you take human beings for animals?
Have Homer, Plato, Phidias, Seneca, Virgil,
Dante, Columbus, Bacon, Galileo, Pascal, Leonardo,
Raphael, Mozart, Beethoven, never had
lofty aspirations? You think our bodies coarse
and repulsive; if you had seen Helen, Phryne,
Aspasia, Sappho, Cleopatra, Lucretia Borgia,
Agnes Sorel, Diane de Poitiers, Marguerite de
Valois, Borghese, Talien, Récamier, Georges,
and their charming rivals, you would perhaps
think differently. Ah, my dear Martial, let
me in my turn regret that you know the Earth
only from afar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"You are mistaken there; I lived in that
world for fifty years. That was enough for
me, and I assure you I would not return to it
again. Everything is a failure there, even&mdash;what
seems most delightful to you. Do you
imagine that in all the earths of heaven the
flowers produce the fruits of the same sorts?
Would not that be a little cruel? As for me,
I like primroses and rosebuds."</p>

<p>"Well, but still," I answered, "notwithstanding
all that, there have been great minds
on the Earth, and creatures really worthy of
admiration. May we not comfort ourselves
with the hope that physical and moral beauty
will go on perfecting themselves more and more
as they have done hitherto, and that intelligence
will enlighten itself progressively? We do not
spend all our time eating. Men will surely
end, in spite of their material labors, by giving
up a few hours every day to the development
of their understanding. Then probably they
will no longer continue to manufacture little
gods in their own image; and perhaps also
they will abolish their childish boundaries, so
that harmony and fraternity may reign."</p>

<p>"No, my friend, for if they wished it, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
could do so now; but they are very careful not
to. Terrestrial man is a little animal who on
the one hand feels no need of thinking, not
even having independence of soul, and who
on the other likes to fight, and squarely establishes
right by
might. Such is
his good pleasure,
and such
is his nature.
You will never
make peaches
grow on a
thorn-bush.
Remember
that the most
exquisite beauties,
to whom
you alluded
just now, are but
coarse monsters compared
to the aerial women of Mars, who live on
our spring air, the perfume of our flowers, and
are so captivating in the very quivering of their
wings, in the ideal kiss of a mouth which has
never eaten, that if Dante's Beatrice had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
been of such a nature, the immortal Florentine
would never have been able to write two of the
parts of his 'Divine Comedy;' he would have
begun with Paradise, and could never have left
it. Reflect that our youths have as much innate
science as Pythagoras, Archimedes, Euclid, Kepler,
Newton, Laplace, and Darwin after all
their laborious studies; our twelve senses put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
us in direct communication with the universe;
we feel from here Jupiter's attraction as he
passes, a hundred million leagues away. We
see the rings of Saturn with the naked eye,
we detect the coming of a comet, and our body
is impregnated with the solar electricity which
puts all Nature in vibration. Here there has
never been either religious fanaticism or executioners,
or martyrs or international divisions
or wars, but from the first, humanity, naturally
peaceful, and freed from all material needs, has
lived independent in body and mind, in a constant
intellectual activity, raising itself unhindered
to the knowledge of the truth. But
come over here."</p>

<p>I walked a few steps on the mountain-top
with my new acquaintances, and coming in
sight of the other slope, I saw multitudes of
different colored lights flitting about in the air.
It was the inhabitants, who, when they desire
it, become luminous at night. Aerial cars,
apparently formed of phosphorescent flowers,
were carrying orchestras and choruses; one of
them passed us, and we took our places in it,
in the midst of a cloud of perfumes. The sensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which I experienced were singularly
unlike any which I had ever felt on the Earth,
and this first night on Mars passed like a rapid
dream; for the dawn found me still in the
aerial car conversing with my entertainers, their
friends, and their indescribably lovely companions.
What a panorama with the rising
sun! Flowers, fruits, perfumes, fairy-like palaces
rose on the islands with their orange
vegetation; the waters stretched themselves out
like limpid mirrors, and joyous aerial couples
were whirling down to these enchanting shores.
There, all material work is done by machines,
and directed by a few perfected races of animals
whose intelligence is very nearly of the same
order as that of mankind on the Earth. The
inhabitants live only for and by the mind; their
nervous system has reached such a degree of
development that each one of these beings, at
once very delicate and very strong, seems an
electric battery, and their most sensual impressions,
felt more by their souls than their bodies,
surpass a hundredfold all those that our five
terrestrial senses together could ever offer us.
A kind of summer palace illuminated by the
rays of the rising Sun opened beneath our aerial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
gondola. My neighbor, whose wings were fluttering
with impatience, placed her delicate foot
upon a tuft of flowers which rose between two
jets of perfume. "Will you return to the
Earth?" she asked, holding out her arms to
me.</p>

<p>"Never," I cried, springing towards her.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But at that moment I found myself alone near
the wood on the slope of the hill, at whose feet
the Seine was winding with undulating curves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

<p>"<i>Never</i>," I repeated, trying to grasp the
sweet, vanished dream once more. Where had I
been? It was beautiful. The Sun had just set,
and the planet Mars, then very brilliant, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
already shining in the sky. "Ah!" I said, as a
fugitive beam reached me, "I have been there!"
Drawn by the same attraction, the two neighboring
planets are looking at each other through
transparent space. May we not catch a first
glimpse of the eternal journey from this celestial
fraternity? The Earth is no longer alone
in the universe. The panoramas of the infinite
are beginning to open themselves out. Whether
we live here or near by, we are not the citizens
of a country or of a world, but are in very
truth the <i>Citizens of Heaven</i>!</p>

<p>Spero's absence in all that vision puzzled me
a little. I still felt so closely attached to his
dear memory that it seemed to me as if I should
have been able to detect his presence, to fly
directly to him, see him, speak to him, hear

I reflected that beings might easily not meet
one another in going about the same city, and
in a world the chances were infinitely less.
And yet surely it was not the doctrine of
chances which should be invoked in this case;
for such a feeling of attraction as that which
had united us ought to increase the probability
of our meeting, and throw an element into the
scale which should outweigh all the rest.</p>

<p>Talking thus with myself, I went back to my
observatory at Juvisy, where I had been preparing
some electric batteries for an optical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
experiment with the tower of Montlhéry. When
I had satisfied myself that everything was in
readiness, I left the task of making the signals
agreed upon, between
ten and
eleven o'clock, to
my assistant, and
went to the old
tower, where I
installed myself
an hour later.
The night had
come. From the
top of the old donjon
the horizon is
perfectly circular, entirely
free in all its
circumference, which
extended on a radius
of twenty to twenty-five
kilometres all
around this central
point. A third post
of observation, situated in Paris, was in communication
with us. The object of the experiment
was to find out whether the rays of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
colors of the luminous spectrum all travel with
the same speed,&mdash;300,000 kilometres a second.
The result was affirmative.</p>

<p>The experiments were ended at about eleven
o'clock, the starry night was marvellous, and
the moon was beginning to rise. As soon as I
had put the apparatus under cover inside the
tower, I went to the upper platform again, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
look at the broad landscape lighted by the
first rays of the waxing moon. The atmosphere
was calm, mild, almost warm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;">
<img src="images/illo_230.jpg" width="513" height="459" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But my foot was still on the last step when I
stopped, terror-stricken, uttering a cry which
seemed to die away in my throat. Spero, yes,
Spero himself, was there, before me, seated on
the parapet! I threw up my arms, and felt as
if I were going to faint; but he said in his
gentle voice, which I knew so well,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do I frighten you?"</p>

<p>I had not strength enough to reply or to advance,
and still I dared to look at my friend,
who was smiling at me. His dear face, lighted
by the moonlight, was just as I had seen it when
he left Paris for Christiania,&mdash;young, pleasant,
and thoughtful, with a very animated look. I
left the stairs, and felt a strong desire to rush to
him and embrace him; but I dared not, and
stood looking at him.</p>

<p>When I had recovered my senses I cried,
"Spero, it is you!"</p>

<p>"I was there during your experiments," he
replied, "and it was I who inspired you with
the idea of comparing the intense violet with
the intense red, for the speed of the luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
waves; only I was invisible, like the ultra-violet
rays."</p>

<p>"Can it really be so? Let me look at you
and feel you."</p>

<p>I passed my hands over his face and body,
through his hair, and had precisely the same
impression as if he had been a living being.
My reason refused to admit the testimony of
my eyes and hands and ears, yet I could not
doubt that it was really he. There could not
be such a resemblance. And then, too, my
doubts would have disappeared at his first
words, for he at once added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My body is at this moment sleeping in Mars."</p>

<p>"So," I said, "you still exist, you are living
now, and you know at last the answer to the
great problem that so distressed you? And
Icléa?"</p>

<p>"We will have a long talk," he answered;
"I have many things to tell you."</p>

<p>I sat down beside him on the edge of the
wide parapet which rises above the old tower,
and this is what I heard.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Shortly after the accident at Lake Tyrifiorden
he had felt like a man who awakes from a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and heavy sleep. He was alone in midnight
darkness on the border of a lake; he knew that
he was living, but could neither see nor feel
himself. The air did not affect him; he was
not only light, but imponderable. Apparently,
what remained of him was solely his thinking
faculty. His first idea on trying to remember
was that he had awakened from his fall by the
Norwegian lake; but when the day broke he
saw that he was in another world. The two
moons revolving rapidly in the sky in opposite
directions made him surmise that he was upon
our neighbor, the planet Mars, and other evidences
soon proved that he was correct.</p>

<p>He lived there for a while in the spirit state,
and recognized there the presence of a very
beautiful humanity, in which the feminine sex
reigns supreme, from an acknowledged superiority
over the masculine sex. These organisms
are light and delicate, their density of
body very slight, their weight slighter still.
On the surface of this world material force
plays but a secondary part in nature; delicacy
of sensation decides everything. There is a
large number of animal species, and several human
races. In all these species and races the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
feminine sex is stronger and handsomer (the
strength consisting in the superiority of sensation)
than the masculine sex, and it is she who
rules the world.</p>

<p>His great desire to know the life before him
induced him not to remain long as an onlooker
in the spirit state, but to come to life again under
a corporeal form, and, knowing the organic condition
of this planet, in a feminine form.</p>

<p>Among the terrestrial souls floating about in
the atmosphere of Mars he had already met
Icléa's (for souls feel each other), who had followed
him, guided by a constant attraction.
She on her part had felt inclined towards a masculine
incarnation. Thus they were reunited,
in one of the most privileged countries in that
world, neighbors and predestined to meet again
in life, to share the same emotions, the same
thoughts, the same works; thus, although the
memory of their earthly life remained veiled
and as if effaced by the new transformation,
yet a vague feeling of spiritual relationship and
an immediate sympathetic attachment had reunited
them as soon as they saw each other.
Their psychic superiority, the nature of their
habitual thoughts, their condition of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
accustomed to seek ends and causes, had given
them both a kind of inward clairvoyance which
freed them from the general ignorance of the
living. They had fallen in love with each other
so suddenly, they had yielded so passively to the
magnetic influence of the thunder-clap of their
meeting, that they soon formed but a single
being, united as at the time of their earthly
separation. They remembered that they had
met before, and were sure that it must have
been on the Earth,&mdash;that neighboring planet
which shines in the evening so brilliantly in the
sky of Mars; and sometimes, in their solitary
flights over the little hills peopled with aerial
plants, they contemplated the "evening star,"
trying to re-tie the broken thread of an interrupted
tradition.</p>

<p>An unexpected event explained their reminiscences,
and proved that they were not
mistaken.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Mars are very superior to
those of Earth by their organizations, by the
number and delicacy of their senses, and by
their intellectual faculties.</p>

<p>The fact that density is very slight on the
surface of that world, and that the constituent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
particles of bodies are less heavy there than
here, has permitted the formation of beings of
incomparably less weight, more aerial, more
delicate, more sensitive. The fact that the atmosphere
is nutritive has freed Martial organisms
from the coarseness of earthly needs. It
is an entirely different state of things. The
light there is less bright, that planet being farther
from the Sun than we, and the optic nerve
is more sensitive. Electric and magnetic influences
being very intense, the inhabitants possess
senses unknown to terrestrial organizations,&mdash;senses
which put them into communication with
these influences. Everything is evenly balanced
in Nature. Beings are everywhere adapted to
their surroundings and to the soil from which
they spring. Organisms can no more be earthly
on Mars than they could be aerial at the bottom
of the sea. More than that, the condition of
superiority generated by this nature of things
is developed of itself by the facility by which
all intellectual work is accomplished. Nature
seems to obey thought. The architect desirous
of erecting a building, the engineer who wants
to change the surface of the ground, either to
lower or to raise, to cut down mountains or fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
up valleys, does not strike against material
weight and material difficulties, as he does here.
Art, too, has made the most rapid progress from
the beginning.</p>

<p>And yet more. Martial humanity, being several
hundreds of thousands of years older than
terrestrial humanity, went through all the phases
of its development before we did; our real scientific
progress, even the most transcendent, is
but a child's foolish toy, compared to the science
of the inhabitants of that planet. In astronomy,
especially, they are incomparably more
advanced than we, and know the Earth much
better than we know their home. They have
invented, among other things, a kind of tele-photographic
apparatus, in which a roll of stuff
constantly receives the picture of our world, and
is impressed by it unalterably as it unrolls. An
immense museum, devoted especially to the
planets of the solar system, preserves all these
photographic pictures, fixed forever in chronological
order.</p>

<p>All the Earth's history is to be found there,&mdash;France
in the time of Charlemagne, Greece in
the days of Alexander, Egypt under Rameses.
By the microscope the smallest details can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
made out, such as Paris during the French Revolution,
Rome under the pontificate of Borgia,
Christopher Columbus's Spanish fleet reaching
America, the Francs of Clovis taking possession
of the Gauls, Julius Cæsar's army stopped in its
conquest of England by the tide which washed
away his ships, the troops of King David, the
founder of standing armies, as well as most historic
scenes, recognizable from special characters
of their own.</p>

<p>One day, when the two friends were visiting
the museum, their reminiscences, which had
been thus far very vague, were brightened, like
a landscape at night, by a flash of lightning.
Suddenly they <i>recognized</i> the appearance of
Paris during the Exposition of 1867. Their
memory became more definite. They each felt,
individually, that they had lived there; and
under this strong impression they also felt
sure that they had lived there together. Their
memory gradually grew clearer, not by interrupted
gleams, but rather as the light grows
stronger from the beginning of dawn.</p>

<p>Then they both remembered, as if by inspiration,
that sentence of Scripture: "In my Father's
house are many mansions;" and this other, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Jesus to Nicodemus: "Verily, I say unto thee,
except a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God.... Ye must be born again."</p>

<p>From that day they never doubted their former
earthly existence, but were convinced that
they were continuing on the planet Mars the life
they had lived before. They belonged to the
cycle of the great minds of all ages, who know
that human destiny does not end with the present
world, but continues in heaven, and who also
know that each planet&mdash;Mars, the Earth, or
any other&mdash;is a star of heaven.</p>

<p>The rather singular fact of the change of sex,
which seemed to me to be very important, was
really without any weight whatever. Spero
told me that souls, contrary to our ideas, have
no sex, and that their destinies are the same. I
also learned that on that planet, so much less
material than our own, organisms have no resemblance
whatever to terrestrial bodies. Conceptions
and births are effected in another way,
which reminds one, but under a more spiritual
form, of the fecundation and blooming of flowers.
Pleasure has no bitterness. Heavy earthly
burdens and the anguish of grief are unknown
there. Everything there is more aerial, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
ethereal, and less material. The Martials might
be called winged, sentient, living flowers; but
in fact no earthly being can serve as comparison
to aid us in imagining their form and manner
of existence.</p>

<p>I listened to the translated soul's story almost
without interrupting him, for it seemed to me
all the time as if he would disappear as he had
come. However, remembering my dream, of
which I had been reminded by the coincidence
of preceding descriptions with what I had seen,
I could not keep from telling my celestial friend
of that surprising vision, and expressing my surprise
at not having seen him on my trip to
Mars,&mdash;a fact which made me doubt the reality
of the journey.</p>

<p>"But," he answered, "I saw you perfectly
well, and you both saw and spoke to me, for it
was I."</p>

<p>The tones of his voice were so odd at these
last words that I suddenly recognized in them
the melodious voice of the beautiful Martial girl
who had so enchanted me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "it was I. I was trying
to make you know me; but you were so bewildered
by a sight which captivated your mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that you did not throw off your terrestrial sensations,&mdash;you
remained sensual and earthly, you
could not rise high enough for pure perception.
Yes, it was I who held out my arms to you in
the aerial car to take you down to our dwelling,
when you suddenly awoke."</p>

<p>"But then," I cried, "if you are that Martial
maiden, how can you appear to me in Spero's
form, when he no longer exists?"</p>

<p>"I do not act upon your retina or your optic
nerve," he replied, "but on your mental being
and your brain. I am in communication with
you now; I influence directly the cerebral seat
of your sensation. My mental being is really
formless, like yours and that of all other souls.
But when I put myself in direct relation with
your thought, as at this moment, you can see me
only as you knew me. It is the same during
your dreams; that is to say, during more than
a quarter of your terrestrial life,&mdash;for twenty
years out of seventy,&mdash;you see, you hear, you
speak, you feel, with the same impression, the
same clearness, the same certainty as during
your normal life; and yet your eyes are closed,
your tympanum is insensible, your mouth is
mute, your arms are stretched out motionless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
It is the same, too, in cases of suggestion, in
conditions of hypnotic somnambulism. You see
me and hear me, you feel me, too, by your brain,
which is under influence; but I am no more in
the form which you see than the rainbow exists
in the presence of the eyes that look at it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illo_243.jpg" width="280" height="586" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Could you also appear to me in your Martial
form?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;at least not unless you were really
transported in spirit to that planet. There would
then be quite a different mode of communication.
In our conversation here, everything is subjective
to you. The elements of my Martial form do
not exist in the terrestrial atmosphere, and your
brain could not imagine them. You can see me
to-day only through the medium of your dream;
but as soon as you try to analyze its details it
will vanish away. You did not see us exactly
as we are, because your mind can judge only by
your earthly eyes, which are not sensitive to all
our radiations, and because you do not possess all
our senses."</p>

<p>"I must confess," I answered, "that I cannot
understand your Martial beings as having six
limbs."</p>

<p>"If these forms were not so graceful, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
would have seemed frightful to you; the organisms
in each world are most appropriate to its
conditions of existence. I
acknowledge, on my part,
that to the inhabitants of
Mars the Apollo Belvedere
and the Venus de Médicis
are actual monstrosities, on
account of their animal
heaviness.</p>

<p>"Everything with us is
exquisitely light, although
our planet is much smaller
than yours; yet the beings
are larger than here, because
the weight is less, and
beings can grow taller without
being impeded by their
weight or imperilling their
stability.</p>

<p>"They are larger and
lighter, because the constructive
materials of that
planet are of very little
density. What would have happened on the
Earth if the weight had not been so great, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
happened there. The winged species would
have ruled over the world, instead of dwindling
away in impossibility of development. On
Mars, organic development is effected in the
series of winged species. Martial humanity is
indeed a race of sextupedal origin; but it is
actually bipedal, bimanous, and what might be
called <i>bialic</i>, since these beings have two wings.</p>

<p>"Their manner of life is totally different from
terrestrial life, in the first place because they
live in the air and on aerial plants as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
they do on the surface of the ground; and
further, because they do not eat, the atmosphere
being nutritive. Passions are not the
same there. Murder is unknown. Humanity,
being without material needs, has never
lived there, even in the primitive ages, in
the barbarity of rapine and war. The ideas
and feelings of the inhabitants of Mars are of
an entirely intellectual nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/illo_244.jpg" width="428" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"Nevertheless, in dwelling on this planet,
analogies at least, if not resemblances, are to be
found. Thus, there is a succession of night and
day there as on the Earth, which does not differ
essentially from what you have, the duration
of night and day being 24 hours, 39 minutes,
35 seconds. As there are 668 of these days
in a Martial year, we have more time than
you for our work, our investigations, and our
enjoyments. Our seasons, too, are almost twice
as long as yours, but they have the same intensity.
The climates are not very different; a
country in Mars, on the shores of the equatorial
sea, differs less from the climate of France than
Lapland differs from Nubia.</p>

<p>"An inhabitant of the Earth would not feel so
very foreign. The greatest difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the two worlds certainly consists in the great
superiority of their humanity over yours.</p>

<p>"This superiority is principally due to the
great progress realized by astronomical science
and to the universal propagation among the inhabitants
of that planet of that science, without
which one has but false ideas of life, of creation,
and of destiny. We are very much favored, as
much by the acuteness of our senses as by the
purity of our skies. There is much less water
on Mars than on the Earth, and fewer clouds.
The sky there is almost always fair, especially
in the temperate zone."</p>

<p>"But still you often have inundations."</p>

<p>"Yes; and quite recently your telescopes
have noticed one along the shores of a sea to
which your colleagues have given a name which
will always be dear to me, even when far from
the Earth. The greater part of our shores are
beaches, level plains. We have few mountains,
and our seas are not deep. The inhabitants
make use of these overflows for irrigating great
stretches of country. They have straightened
and enlarged the watercourses and made them
like canals, and have constructed a network of
immense canals all over the continents. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
continents themselves are not bristling all over
with Alpine or Himalayan upheavals like those
of the terrestrial globe, but are <i>immense plains</i>,
crossed in all directions by canals, which connect
all the seas with one another, and by streams
made to resemble canals. Formerly there was
as much water on Mars, in proportion to the size
of the planet, as on the Earth; gradually, from
age to age, a part of the rain-water sank into
the depths of the soil and did not return to the
surface. It combined itself chemically with the
rocks, and was withdrawn from atmospheric circulation.
Then, too, from age to age, rains,
snows, and winds, winter frosts and summer
droughts, have disintegrated the mountains, and
the watercourses, bringing fragments to the sea-basins,
have gradually raised their beds. We
have no more large oceans or deep seas,&mdash;nothing
but inland waters; many straits, gulfs,
and seas analogous to the Channel, the Red Sea,
the Adriatic, the Baltic, and the Caspian;
pleasant shores, quiet harbors, large lakes and
streams, aerial rather than aquatic fleets, an
almost always clear sky, especially in the morning.
There are no mornings on Earth so luminous
as ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
"The meteorological system differs materially
from that of the Earth, because, the atmosphere
being more rarified, the waters which move over
the surface evaporate more easily, and then because
in condensing again, instead of forming
clouds that last, they pass almost without transition
from the gaseous to the liquid state. There
are few clouds and few fogs.</p>

<p>"Astronomy is cultivated there on account of
the clearness of the heavens. We have two
satellites, whose courses would appear strange to
earthly astronomers, for while one of them gives
us months of a hundred and thirty hours, or five
Martial days, plus eight hours, the other, by a
combination of its motion with the daily rotation
of the planet, rises in the occident and sets
in the orient, crossing the sky from west to east
in five hours and a half, and passing from one
phase to the other in less than three hours.
That spectacle is unique in the whole solar
system, and has done much to attract the attention
of the inhabitants to the study of the
sky. Besides that, we have eclipses of the moon
almost every day, but never total eclipses of
the Sun, because our satellites are too small.</p>

<p>"The Earth looks to us as Venus looks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
you. To us it is the morning and evening
star; and in old times, before the invention of
optical instruments, which have taught us that
it is a planet, dwelt upon like ours, but by an
inferior race, our ancestors worshipped it as a
tutelary divinity. All worlds have a mythology
during their centuries of infancy, and this
mythology has for its origin, its foundation,
and its object the appearance of the celestial
bodies.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the Earth, accompanied by the
Moon, passes between us and the Sun, and projects
itself upon its disk like a little black spot,
attended by a still smaller one. Every one there
follows these celestial phenomena with curiosity.
Our newspapers think more of science than of
theatres, literary fancies, or political quarrels.</p>

<p>"The Sun looks smaller to us, and we receive
a little less light and heat from it; our more
sensitive eyes see better than yours. The
temperature is a little higher."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" said I. "You are farther
from the Sun, yet are warmer than we?"</p>

<p>"Chamounix is a little farther from noonday
sun than Mont Blanc," he answered. "The distance
from the Sun does not alone regulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
temperature, you must also take into account
the constitution of the atmosphere. Our polar
ice melts under our summer sun more entirely
than yours."</p>

<p>"What lands in Mars are most populous?"</p>

<p>"There is very little, except the polar regions
(where, from the Earth, you see the snow and
ice melt every spring), which is uninhabited.
The population of the temperate regions is very
dense, but in the equatorial lands it is more so;
the population there is as dense as in China,&mdash;and
especially the sea-coasts, notwithstanding
the inundations. A large number of cities are
built almost on the water, suspended in the air
in some way above the overflows, which are
calculated and expected beforehand."</p>

<p>"Are your arts and your industries like ours?
Have you railways, steamships, the telegraph,
and the telephone?"</p>

<p>"It is all quite different. We have never had
either steam or railways, because we have always
known of electricity, and aerial navigation is
natural to us. Our fleets are moved by electricity,
and are more aerial than aquatic. We live
principally in the air, and have no homes of
stone, iron, or wood. We do not experience the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
rigors of winter, because no one stays exposed
to them. Those who do not dwell in the equatorial
countries emigrate every autumn, just as
your birds do. It would be very difficult for you
to form an exact idea of our manner of life."</p>

<p>"Are there many human beings on Mars who
have already lived on the Earth?"</p>

<p>"No; among the inhabitants of your planet
the greater part are either ignorant, sceptical, or
indifferent, and are unprepared for the spiritual
life. They are attached to the Earth, and their
attachment lasts for a long time. Many souls
sleep completely. Those which act, live, and
aspire to know the truth, are the only ones
called to conscious immortality, the only ones
whom the spirit-world interests, and who are
capable of understanding it. These souls can
leave the Earth and live in other lands. Many
come and live for a while on Mars (the first
stage of an ultra-terrestrial journey, going from
the Sun), or on Venus, the first abode going the
other way; but Venus is a world analogous to
the Earth, and still less favored, on account of
its too rapid seasons, which oblige its inhabitants
to suffer the most sudden changes of temperature.
Certain spirits wing their way at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the starry regions. As you know, space has
no existence. To sum up, justice reigns in the
moral world as equilibrium does in the physical
world; and the destiny of souls is but the perpetual
result of their capabilities, their aspirations,
and consequently of <i>their works</i>. The
Uranian way is open to all; but the soul becomes
truly Uranian only when it has entirely
shaken off the weight of material life. The day
will come, even on your planet, when there will
be no other belief, no other religion, than the
knowledge of the universe and the certainty of
immortality in its infinite regions, in its eternal
domain."</p>

<p>"What a strange thing," said I, "that no one
on the Earth should know these sublime truths!
No one looks at the sky; we live as though our
little isle alone existed in the universe."</p>

<p>"Terrestrial humanity is young," answered
Spero. "You must not despair. It is a child,
and still in primitive ignorance. It is amused
at trifles, and obeys masters of its own giving.
You like to divide yourselves into nations, to
trick yourselves out in national costumes, and
to exterminate each other to music! Then you
raise statues to those who have led you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
butchery. You ruin yourselves, you commit
suicide, and yet you cannot live without wresting
your daily bread from the Earth. That is a
sad condition of things, but one which fully
satisfies the greater part of the dwellers on your
planet. If some of them, with higher aspirations,
think occasionally of problems of the
higher order, of the nature of the soul or the
existence of God, the result has been no better,
because they have put their souls outside of
Nature, and have invented strange, horrible
gods, who never existed except in their perverted
imaginations, and in whose name they
have committed all kinds of outrages against
the human conscience, have blessed all crimes,
and bound weak minds in a slavery from
which it will be difficult for them to escape.
The lowest animal on Mars is better, finer, gentler,
more intelligent, and greater than the god
of the armies of David, Constantine, Charlemagne,
and all your crowned assassins. There
is therefore nothing surprising in the coarseness
and stupidity of terrestrial humanity. But the
law of progress governs the world. You are
more advanced than at the period of your ancestors
of the stone age, whose wretched existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
was spent in fighting night and day with ferocious
beasts. In a few thousands of years you
will be more advanced than you are now. Then
Urania will reign in your hearts."</p>

<p>"It would require a brutal material fact to
teach and convince human beings. If, for instance,
we could some day enter into communication
with the neighboring world which you
inhabit, not into physical communication with
one isolated person of it, as I am now doing,
but with the planet itself, by hundreds and
thousands of witnesses, that would be a gigantic
stride towards progress."</p>

<p>"You could do it now if you chose, for we
Martials are all prepared for it, and have even
tried it many times. But you have never replied
to us. Solar reflections, showing geometrical
figures on our vast plains, prove to you that we
exist. You could reply to us by like figures also
displayed on your plains, either during the day
by the sun, or during the night by the electric
light. But you never even think of it; and if
some one should propose to try it, your courts
would interpose to prevent it, for the very idea
is immeasurably too high for the general approval
of the denizens of your planet. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
do your scientific assemblies work for? The
preservation of the past. To what do your
political assemblies direct their attention? Increasing
the taxes. In the land of the blind,
one-eyed men are kings.</p>

<p>"But you must not utterly despair. Progress
bears you on in spite of yourselves. One of
these days, too, you will realize that you are
citizens of the sky; then you will live in the
light, in knowledge, in the mind's true world."</p>

<p>While the inhabitant of Mars was teaching
me the principal characteristics of his new country,
the terrestrial globe had turned towards the
east, the horizon had sunk lower, and the Moon
had gradually risen in the sky, which she was
illuminating with her radiance.</p>

<p>Suddenly chancing to lower my eyes to where
Spero sat, I could not repress a start of surprise.
The moonlight was streaming over him as it
did over me, and yet, although my body cast a
shadow on the parapet, his figure was shadowless.
I arose abruptly to assure myself of this
fact. I turned about at once and stretched out
my hand to touch his shoulder, watching the
shadow of my gesture on the parapet. But my
visitor had instantly disappeared. I was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
alone on the silent tower. My very dark
shadow was thrown out sharply on the parapet.
The Moon was brilliant, the village was sleeping
at my feet. The air was mild and very still.
And yet I thought I heard footsteps. I listened,
and indeed did hear rather heavy footsteps coming
towards me. Some one was evidently climbing
the tower-stairs.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has not gone down yet?" said the
custodian, coming up to the top. "I was waiting
to lock the doors, and thought the experiments
must be over."</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIXED POINT IN THE UNIVERSE.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="dropleftmin">HE</span> memory of Urania and the celestial
journey on which she had borne me away,
the truths she had made me realize, Spero's history,
his trials in his pursuit of the absolute,
his apparition, his story of another world, still
haunted me, and kept the same problems (partly
solved, partly veiled in the uncertainty of our
knowledge) incessantly before my mind. I felt
that I had gradually risen to a perception of the
truth, and that the visible universe was really
but an appearance, which we must pass through
in order to reach reality.</p>

<p>The testimony of our senses is but an illusion.
The Earth is not what it seems to be. Nature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
not what we think. In the physical universe
itself, where is the fixed point upon which material
creation is in equilibrium?</p>

<p>The natural and direct impression given by
the observation of Nature is that we inhabit a
solid, stable Earth, fixed in the centre of the universe.
It took long centuries of study and a
great deal of boldness to free ourselves from
that natural conviction, and to realize that the
world we are on is isolated in space, without any
support whatever, in rapid motion on itself and
around the Sun. But to the ages before scientific
analysis, to primitive peoples, and even
to-day to three quarters of the human race, our
feet are resting on a solid Earth which is fixed
at the base of the universe, and whose foundations
are supposed to extend into the depths of
the infinite.</p>

<p>And yet from the time when it was first realized
that it is the same Sun which rises and sets
every day; that it is the same Moon, the same
stars, the same constellations which revolve
about us, those very facts forced one to admit
with absolute certainty that there must be empty
space underneath the Earth, to let the stars of
the firmament pass from their setting to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
rising. This first recognition was a turning-point.
The admission of the Earth's isolation
in space was astronomy's first triumph. It was
the first step, and indeed the most difficult one.
Think of it! To give up the foundations of
the Earth! Such an idea would never have
sprung from any brain without the study of the
stars, or indeed without the transparency of the
atmosphere. Under a perpetually cloudy sky,
human thoughts would have remained fixed on
terrestrial ground like the oyster to the rock.</p>

<p>The Earth once isolated in space, the first
step was taken. Before this revolution, whose
philosophical bearing equals its scientific value,
all manner of shapes had been imagined for
our sublunary dwelling-place. In the first place,
the Earth was thought to be an island emerging
from a boundless ocean, the island having infinite
roots. Then the Earth, with its seas, was
supposed to be a flat, circular disk, all around
which rested the vault of the firmament. Later,
cubic, cylindrical, polyhedric forms, etc., were
imagined. But still the progress of navigation
tended to reveal its spherical nature, and when
its isolation, with its incontestable proofs, was
recognized, this sphericity was admitted as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
natural corollary of that isolation and of the
circular motion of the celestial spheres around
the supposed central globe.</p>

<p>The terrestrial globe being from that time recognized
as isolated, to move it was no longer
difficult. Formerly, when the sky was looked
upon as a dome crowning the massive and
unlimited Earth, the very idea of supposing it
to be in motion would have been not only absurd
but untenable. But from the time that
we could see it in our minds, placed like a
globe in the centre of celestial motion, the idea
of imagining that perhaps this globe could revolve
on itself, so as to avoid obliging the whole
sky and the immense universe to perform this
daily task, might come naturally into a thinker's
mind; and indeed we see the hypothesis of
the daily rotation of the terrestrial sphere coming
to light in ancient civilizations, among the
Greeks, the Egyptians, the Indians, etc. It is
sufficient to read a few chapters of Ptolemy,
Plutarch, or Surya-Siddhanta for an account
of these conjectures. But this new hypothesis,
although it had been prepared for by the first
one, was none the less bold, and contrary to the
feelings inspired by the direct contemplation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Nature. Thoughtful mankind was obliged to
wait until the sixteenth century, or, to speak
more correctly, until the seventeenth century,
to learn our planet's true position in the universe,
and to <i>know</i> by supported proofs that it
has a double movement,&mdash;daily about itself,
and yearly about the Sun. From that time only,
from the time of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler,
and Newton, has real astronomy existed.</p>

<p>And yet again, that was but a beginning, for
the great remodeller of the world's system, Copernicus
himself, had no suspicion of the Earth's
other motions, or of the distances of the stars.
It is only in our own century that the first measurements
of the distances of the stars could be
made, and it is only in our day that sidereal
discoveries have afforded us the necessary data
by which we might endeavor to account for the
forces which maintain the equilibrium of creation.</p>

<p>The ancient idea of endless roots attributed
to the Earth, evidently left much to be desired
to minds anxious to go to the bottom of things.
It is absolutely impossible for us to conceive of
a material pillar, as thick and as wide as you
like (of the diameter of the Earth, for example),
sinking down into the infinite; just as one cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
admit the real existence of a stick which
should have but one end. No matter how far
our mind goes down towards the base of such a
material pillar, there is a point where it can see
the end of it. The difficulty had been obviated
by materializing the celestial sphere and putting
the Earth inside it, occupying all its lower
portion. But in the first place it became difficult
to adjust the motion of the stars, and on
the other hand this material universe itself,
enclosed in an immense crystal globe, was held
up by nothing, since the infinite must extend
all around, beneath it, as well as above. Investigating
minds were at first obliged to free
themselves from the vulgar idea of weight.</p>

<p>Isolated in space like a child's balloon floating
in the air, and more absolutely too, for the balloon
is carried by aerial waves, while worlds
gravitate in the void, the Earth is a toy for the
invisible cosmic forces which it obeys,&mdash;a real
soap-bubble, sensitive to the faintest breath.
Besides, we can easily judge of it by looking at
the same time at the whole of the <i>eleven</i> principal
motions of the Earth, by which it is moved.
Perhaps they will help us to find that "fixed
point" which our philosophical ambition asks for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Thrown around the Sun at a distance of
37,000,000 leagues, and making at this distance
its annual revolution around the luminous star,
it consequently moves at the rate of 643,000
leagues per day; that is, 26,800 leagues an
hour, or 29,450 metres per second. This speed
is eleven hundred times more rapid than an
express train going at the rate of a hundred
kilometres an hour. It is a ball, going with a
rapidity seventy-five times greater than that of
a bomb, always hurrying on, but never reaching
its goal. In 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and
10 seconds, the terrestrial projectile has returned
to the same point of its orbit relative to the
Sun, and continues its flight. The Sun, on its
part, is moving in space, following a line oblique
to the plane of the Earth's annual motion,&mdash;a
line drawn towards the constellation of Hercules.
The result is, that instead of describing an exact
circle, the Earth describes a spiral, and has never
passed over the same road twice in its existence.
To its motion of annual revolution around the
Sun there is added perpetually, as a second motion,
that of the Sun itself, which draws it, with
all the solar system, into an oblique descent
towards the constellation of Hercules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
During all this time our little globe pirouettes
around itself every twenty-four hours, and gives
us the daily succession of days and nights,&mdash;diurnal
rotation: third motion.</p>

<p>It does not turn upright upon itself, like a
top, which would be vertical on a table, but is
inclined, as everybody knows, by 23° 27'. This
inclination, too, is not always the same; it varies
from year to year, from age to age, oscillating
slowly by secular periods. That is a fourth kind
of motion.</p>

<p>The orbit in which our planet yearly travels
around the Sun is not circular, but elliptical.
This ellipse itself also varies from year to
year, and from century to century; sometimes
it approaches the circumference of a circle, sometimes
it lengthens out to a great eccentricity.
It is like an elastic ring, which can be bent more
or less out of shape. Fifth complication in the
Earth's motion.</p>

<p>This ellipse itself is not fixed in space, but
revolves in its own plane in a period of 21,000
years. The perihelion, which at the beginning
of our era was at 65 degrees of longitude, starting
from the vernal equinox, is now at 101 degrees.
This secular displacement of the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the apsides brings a sixth complication to the
motion of our abiding-place.</p>

<p>Here is a seventh. We said just now that our
globe's axis of rotation is inclined, and everybody
knows that the imaginary prolongation of
this axis points towards the polar star. This
axis itself is not fixed. It revolves in 25,765
years, keeping its inclination of 22 to 24 degrees,
so that its prolongation describes a circle
of 44 to 48 degrees in diameter&mdash;according to
the epoch&mdash;on the celestial sphere around the
pole of the ecliptic. It is in consequence of this
displacement of the pole that Vega, in twelve
thousand years, will again become the polar
star, as she was fourteen thousand years ago.
Seventh kind of movement.</p>

<p>An eighth motion, due to the action of the
Moon on the equatorial swelling of the Earth,
that of nutation, causes the pole of the equator
to describe a small ellipse in eighteen years and
eight months.</p>

<p>A ninth, due also to the attraction of our
satellite, incessantly changes the position of the
globe's centre of gravity and the Earth's place in
space. When the Moon is in front of us, she
accelerates the speed of the globe; when she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
behind, she retards us, on the contrary, like a
check-rein,&mdash;a monthly complication which is
added to all the others.</p>

<p>When the Earth passes between the Sun and
Jupiter, the attraction of the latter, in spite of
its distance of 155,000,000 leagues, makes it deviate
by 2 m. 10 sec. from its absolute orbit. The
attraction of Venus makes it deviate 1 m. 25 sec.
the other way. Saturn and Mars also act upon
it, but more feebly. These are exterior disturbances,
which make up a tenth kind of correction
to add to the motion of our celestial barque.</p>

<p>The whole of the planets weigh about one
seven hundredth part of the weight of the Sun;
the centre of gravity around which the Earth
annually turns is not in the very centre of the
Sun, but far from the centre, and often even
outside of the solar globe. Now, absolutely
speaking, the Earth does not turn around the
Sun; but the two heavenly bodies, Sun and Earth,
turn about their common centre of gravity. Thus
the centre of our planet's annual motion is constantly
changing place, and we may add this
eleventh complication to the others. We might
even add many others to these; but the preceding
ones are enough to make the degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
lightness and delicacy of our floating island appreciated,
subject, as we have seen, to all the
fluctuations of celestial influences. Mathematical
analysis goes very far beyond this summary
statement. It has found that the Moon alone,
which seems to turn so peacefully about us, has
more than sixty distinct motions.</p>

<p>The expression is therefore not exaggerated:
our planet is but the plaything of the cosmic
forces which accompany it in the meadows of
the sky, and it is the same with everything
existing in the universe. Matter is meekly
obedient to force.</p>

<p>Where, then, is the fixed point which we
desire for our support?</p>

<p>Our planet, then, formerly supposed to be at
the base of the universe, is in fact kept up at a
distance by the Sun, which makes the Earth
gravitate about it with a speed corresponding
to that distance. This speed, caused by the
solar mass itself, keeps our planet at the same
mean distance from the central star. A lesser
speed would make the weight predominate, and
would lead to the Earth's falling into the Sun;
a greater speed, on the contrary, would progressively
and infinitely send our planet away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
its life-giving focus. But at the speed resulting
from gravitation, our wandering home remains
suspended in permanent stability, just as the
Moon is upheld in space by the force of the
Earth's gravity, which makes it circulate about
the Earth with the speed requisite to maintain
it constantly at the same mean distance. The
Earth and the Moon thus form a planetary couple
in space which sustain each other in perpetual
equilibrium under the supreme domination of
solar attraction. If the Earth existed alone in
the universe, it would be forever motionless in
the void, wherever it had been placed, with no
power to descend or rise or change its position
in any way whatsoever; these very expressions&mdash;to
rise, descend, left or right&mdash;having no
absolute sense whatever. If this same Earth,
while existing alone, had received any impetus
whatever, had been thrown with any speed in
any direction, it would have whirled away forever
in a straight line in that direction, never
being able to stop or to slacken its pace or
change its motion. It would have been the
same thing if the Moon had existed alone with
it; they would both have turned about their
common centre of gravity, fulfilling their destiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in the same place in space, flying together,
following the direction in which they had been
thrown. The Sun existing and being the centre
of its system, the Earth, all the planets and
their satellites, are dependent upon it, and to
it their destiny is irrevocably bound.</p>

<p>Is the fixed point that we are seeking, the
solid base which we seem to need to insure the
stability of the universe, to be found in that
colossal and heavy globe, the Sun?</p>

<p>Assuredly not, since the Sun itself is not in
repose, for it is bearing us and all its system
away towards the constellation of Hercules.</p>

<p>Does our Sun gravitate around an immense
sun whose attraction extends to it and controls
its destinies as it controls that of the planets?
Do investigations in sidereal astronomy lead us
to believe that a star of such magnitude can
exist in a direction situated at right angles with
our course towards Hercules? No; our Sun is
influenced by sidereal attraction, but no one
star appears to overpower all the others and
reign sovereign over our central star.</p>

<p>Although it may be perfectly admissible, or
rather certain, that the sun nearest to ours,
the star Alpha Centauri, and our own Sun feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
their mutual attraction; although this star may
be situated at about 90 degrees from our tangent
towards Hercules, and, more than that, in the
plane of the principal stars, passing by Perseus,
Capella, Vega, Aldebaran, and the Southern Cross;
and although the proper motion of this neighboring
sun may be turned sensibly in the opposite
direction from ours,&mdash;yet we could not consider
these two systems as forming one couple analogous
to that of the double stars; in the first
place, because all the known double-star systems
are composed of stars much nearer to each other,
and then because in the immensity of the orbit
described, according to this hypothesis, the attraction
of the neighboring stars could not be
considered as remaining without influence; and
lastly, because the actual rates of speed with
which these two suns are moved are much less
great than those which would result from their
mutual attraction.</p>

<p>The little constellation of Perseus, especially,
might very well exert a more powerful action
than that of the Pleiades, or than any other
group of stars, and be the fixed point, the centre
of gravity, of the motions of our Sun, of Alpha
Centauri, and the neighboring stars, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
as the cluster of Perseus is not only at right
angles with the tangent of our movement towards
Hercules, but also in the great circle of
the principal stars and precisely at the intersection
of this circle with the Milky Way. But
here another factor comes in, of more importance
than all the preceding ones,&mdash;this Milky Way,
with its eighteen millions of suns, of which it
would assuredly be audacious to seek the centre
of gravity.</p>

<p>But what is the whole entire Milky Way, after
all, compared with the milliards of stars which
our mind contemplates in the bosom of the sidereal
universe? Is not this Milky Way itself
moving like an archipelago of floating islands?
Is not every resolvable nebula, each cluster of
stars, a Milky Way in motion under the action of
the gravitation of other universes, which call to
it and appeal to it through the infinite night?</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Our thoughts are transported from star to
star, from system to system, from region to
region, in the presence of unfathomable grandeurs,
in sight of celestial motions whose speed
we are but just beginning properly to value, but
which already surpasses all conception. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
proper annual motion of the sun Alpha Centauri
exceeds 188 millions of leagues per year.
The proper motion of the 61st of Cygnus (second
sun in the order of distances) is equivalent to
370 millions of leagues per year, or about one
million of leagues per day. The star Alpha
Cygni comes to us in a direct line at a speed of
500 millions of leagues per year. The proper
motion of the star 1830 of Groombridge's Catalogue
rises to 2,590 millions of leagues per year,
which represents seven millions of leagues per
day, 115,000 kilometres per hour, or 320,000
metres per second! These are minimum estimates,
inasmuch as we certainly do not see
perpendicularly, but obliquely, the stellar displacements
thus measured.</p>

<p>What projectiles! They are suns thousands
and millions of times heavier than the Earth,
launched through the unfathomable void with
giddy rates of speed, revolving in immensity
under the influence of the gravitation of all the
stars of the universe. And these millions and
thousand millions of suns, planets, clusters of
stars, nebulæ, worlds in their infancy, worlds near
their end, rush with equal velocity towards goals
of which they are ignorant, with an energy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
intensity of action before which gunpowder and
dynamite are like the breath of sleeping babes.</p>

<p>And thus everything hurries on through all
eternity perhaps, without being able ever to
reach the unexisting limits of infinity....
Motion, activity, light, life everywhere. Happily
so, without doubt. If all these innumerable
suns, planets, earths, moons, comets, were fixed
and immovable, petrified kings in their eternal
tombs, how much more formidable, but also
more mournful, would be the aspect of such a
universe! Can you imagine the whole creation
stopped, benumbed, mummified? Is not such
an idea unbearable? Is there not something
funereal about it?</p>

<p>What causes these motions? What maintains
them? What regulates them? Universal gravitation,
invisible force, which the visible universe
(what we call matter) obeys. A body attracted
from infinity by the Earth would attain a velocity
of 11,300 metres per second; just as a
body thrown from the Earth with that speed
would never fall again. A body attracted by
the Sun from the infinite would attain a speed
of 608,000 metres; and a body thrown by the
Sun with that swiftness would never return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
its point of departure. Clusters of stars may
give us velocities much more remarkable still,
but which are explained by the theory of gravitation.
A glance at a map of the proper motions
of the stars is enough to make one understand
the variety and grandeur of these motions.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Thus the stars, the suns, the planets, the
worlds, the shooting-stars, the meteoric stones,
in short all the bodies which constitute this vast
universe, rest, not on solid bases, as the childish
and primitive conception of our fathers seemed
to require, but <i>upon invisible and immaterial
forces</i> which govern their motions. These milliards
of celestial bodies have their respective
movements for the purpose of stability, and
mutually lean upon each other across the void
which separates them. The mind which could
eliminate time and space would see the Earth,
the planets, the Sun, the stars, rain down from
a limitless sky in all imaginable directions, like
the drops carried away by the whirlwinds of a
gigantic tempest, and drawn, not by a common
basis, but by the attraction of each and all;
each one of these cosmic drops, each one of
these worlds, each one of these suns, is whirled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
away at a speed so rapid that the flight of
cannon-balls is but rest in comparison: it is not
one hundred, nor five hundred, nor a thousand
metres per second,&mdash;it is ten thousand, twenty,
fifty, a hundred, and even two or three hundred
thousand metres <i>per second</i>!</p>

<p>How is it that there are no meetings in the
midst of all this motion? Perhaps there may
be some,&mdash;the "temporary stars," which appear
to rise again from their ashes, would seem to
indicate it. But as a matter of fact, it would
be difficult for meetings to occur, because space
is immense, relatively to the celestial bodies, and
because the motion by which each body is animated
entirely prevents it from submitting passively
to the attraction of another body and
falling upon it; it keeps its own motion, which
cannot be destroyed, and glides around the focus
which attracts it, as a butterfly would obey the
attraction of a flame without burning itself in
it. Besides, absolutely speaking, these motions
are not "rapid."</p>

<p>Indeed, everything runs, flies, falls, rolls, rushes
through the void, but at such respective distances
that it all appears to be at rest. If we wanted
to place in a frame, the size of Paris, the stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
whose distances have been measured up to the
present time, the nearest star would be placed
at two kilometres from the Sun, from which the
Earth would be distant one centimetre, Jupiter
at five centimetres, and Neptune at thirty centimetres.
The 61st of Cygnus would be at four
kilometres, Sirius at ten kilometres, the polar
star at twenty-seven kilometres, etc.; and the
immense majority of the stars would remain
outside the department of the Seine. Well,
to give to all these projectiles their relative
motions, the Earth would take a year to run
through its orbit of a centimetre radius, Jupiter
twelve years to run through his of five centimetres,
and Neptune one hundred and sixty-five
years. The proper motions of the Sun and stars
would be of the same nature; that is to say,
all would appear to be at rest, even under the
microscope. Urania reigns with calmness and
serenity in the immensity of the universe.</p>

<p>So the constitution of the sidereal universe is
just like that of the bodies which we call material.
All bodies, organic or inorganic, man,
animal, plant, stone, iron, bronze, are composed
of molecules which are in perpetual motion, and
which do not touch one another. Each one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
these atoms is infinitely small, and invisible not
only to the eye, not only to the microscope, but
even to thought; since it is possible that these
atoms may be centres of force. It has been calculated
that in the head of a pin there are not
less than eight sextillions of atoms,&mdash;that is,
eight thousand milliards of milliards,&mdash;and that
in one centimetre of cubic air there are not less
than a sextillion of molecules. All these atoms,
all these molecules, are in motion under the influence
of the forces which govern them; and as
compared with their dimensions, great distances
separate them. We may even believe that there
is in principle but one kind of atoms, and that
it is the number of primitive atoms, essentially
simple and homogeneous, their modes of arrangement,
and their motions, which constitute
the diversity of molecules; a molecule of gold,
of iron, would not differ from a molecule of sulphur,
of oxygen, of hydrogen, etc., except in the
number, the disposition, and the motion of the
primitive atoms which compose it: each molecule
would be a system, a microcosm.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the idea that one conceives
of the inner constitution of bodies, the
truth is now recognized and indisputable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the fixed point for which our imagination has
been seeking, exists nowhere. Archimedes can
vainly call for a point of support, that he may
lift the world. <i>Worlds, like atoms, rest on the
invisible</i>, on immaterial force; everything moves,
urged on by attraction, and as if in search of
that fixed point which flies as it is pursued, and
which does not exist, since in the infinite the
centre is everywhere and nowhere. So-called
positive minds, which assert with so much assurance
that "Matter reigns alone, with its
properties," and who smile disdainfully at the
researches of thinkers, should first tell us what
they mean by that famous word "matter." If
they did not stop at the surface of things, if they
even suspected that appearances hid intangible
realities, they would doubtless be a little more
modest.</p>

<p>To us, who seek the truth with no jealousy
of system, it seems that the essence of matter
remains as mysterious as the essence of force;
the visible universe not being in the least
what it appears to be to our senses. In fact,
that visible universe is composed of invisible
atoms; it rests upon the void, and the forces
which govern it are in themselves immaterial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and invisible. It would be less bold to think
that matter does not exist, that all is dynamism,
than to pretend to affirm the existence of an
exclusively material universe. As to the material
support of the world, it disappeared&mdash;a
somewhat interesting observation&mdash;precisely
with the conquest of Mechanics, which proclaim
the triumph of the invisible. The fixed point
vanishes in the universal balance of powers, in
the ideal harmony of ether vibrations; the more
one seeks it, the less one finds it; and the last
effort of our thought has for a last support, for
supreme reality, the Infinite.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SOUL_CLOTHED_WITH_AIR" id="A_SOUL_CLOTHED_WITH_AIR">A SOUL CLOTHED WITH AIR.</a></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="dropleftmid">HE</span> was standing, in her chaste nudity, with
uplifted arms, twisting the thick and
waving masses of her hair, which she was trying
to bring into subjection on the top of her head,&mdash;a
fresh, young beauty, who had not yet attained
the fulness and perfection of developed<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
form, but was approaching it, radiant in the
loveliness of her seventeenth year.</p>

<p>A child of Venice, her white, soft, rose-tinted
skin revealed the circulation of a strong and
ardent life-blood beneath its transparency; her
eyes shone with a mysterious and haunting light,
and the dewy redness of her lightly parted lips
made one think of the fruit as much as of the
flower. She was marvellously beautiful as she
stood thus; and if some hero Paris had received
a mission to award the palm to her, I do not
know which he would have laid at her feet,
that of grace, elegance, or beauty,&mdash;for she
seemed to blend the living charm of modern
attractiveness with the calm perfections of
classic beauty.</p>

<p>The happiest, the most unexpected chance
had led the painter Falero and me to where she
was. One lovely afternoon last spring we were
walking on the seashore. We had been through
one of the groves of olive-trees, with their sad-looking
leaves, which are so frequent between
Nice and Monaco, and without being aware of
it had entered some private grounds which were
unenclosed on the side towards the beach.
A picturesque, winding path led up the hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
We had just passed an orange-grove whose
golden apples recalled the garden of the Hesperides;
the air was fragrant, the sky a deep
blue, and we were discoursing upon a parallel
between art and science, when my companion
suddenly stopped, as if by an irresistible fascination,
making me a sign to be silent and
to look.</p>

<p>Behind the clumps of cactus and fig-trees, a
few feet in front of us, was a sumptuous bathroom,
with its western window open, letting us
see the young girl standing not far from a
marble basin into which a jet of water fell
with a gentle murmur, and before a large
mirror which reflected her image from head to
foot. Probably the noise of the falling water
had prevented her hearing our footsteps. We
stood mute and motionless behind the cactus,
discreetly, or indiscreetly, watching her. She
was lovely, and apparently unaware of her own
beauty. Her feet were on a tiger-skin; she was
in no haste. Finding that her hair was still too
damp, she let it fall about her again, turned in
our direction, and picked up a rose from the
table near the window; then going back to the
long mirror, she resumed her hair-dressing, finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it leisurely, put the little rose between
two coils, and turning with her back to the sun,
stooped, probably to pick up her first piece of
clothing. But she suddenly sprang back with a
piercing cry, hid her face in her hands, and
hastily retreated to a shaded corner.</p>

<p>We have always thought since that some
movement of our heads must have betrayed our
presence, or that by some trick of the mirror she
had seen us. Whatever it was, we thought it
prudent to retrace our steps, and went down to
the sea again by the same path.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"Ah," said my companion, "I assure you
that among all my models I have never seen
any more perfect, even for my picture of the
'Double Stars' and of 'Celia.' What do you
think about it yourself? Did not that apparition
come just in time to prove that I am
right? You need waste no eloquence upon the
delights of science,&mdash;acknowledge that art also
has its charms. Do not the stars of Earth compare
favorably with the beauties of the sky?
Do you not admire the graceful beauty of that
form as I do? What exquisite tints, what
flesh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
"I should not have the bad taste not to
admire what is truly beautiful," I answered.
"I admit that human beauty (and of course
female loveliness in particular) truly represents
the most perfect thing that Nature has
produced on our planet. But do you know
what I most admire in that being? It is not
its artistic or æsthetic aspect, it is the scientific
proof it gives of a simply wonderful fact.
In that beautiful body I see a soul clothed
with air."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are fond of paradoxes! A soul
clothed with air! That is rather idealistic for
so real a body! No doubt the charming creature
has a soul; but permit an artist to admire her
body, her vitality, her solidity, her color...."</p>

<p>"I do not object. But it is just that physical
beauty which makes me admire the soul in her,
the invisible force that formed her."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that? We surely
have a body! The existence of a soul is less
palpable."</p>

<p>"To the senses, yes; to the mind, no. Now,
your senses absolutely deceive you about the
motion of the Earth, the nature of the sky, the
apparent solidity of the body; about beings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
about things. Will you follow my reasoning for
a moment?</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">

</div>

<p>"When I breathe the perfume of a rose, when
I admire the beauty of form, the smoothness of
coloring, the grace of this flower in its freshly
opening bloom, what strikes me most is the
work of the hidden, unknown, mysterious force
which rules over the plant's life and can direct
it in the maintenance of its existence, which
chooses the proper molecules of air, water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
earth for its nourishment, and which knows
above all how to assimilate those molecules and
group them so delicately as to form this graceful
stem, these dainty little green leaves, these soft
pink petals, these exquisite tints and delicious
fragrance. This mysterious force is the animating
principle of the plant. Put a lily-seed,
an acorn, a grain of wheat, and a peach-stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
side by side in the ground; each germ will
build up its own organism.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/illo_286.jpg" width="358" height="445" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"I knew a maple-tree which was dying on the
ruins of an old wall, a few feet from good, rich
soil in a ditch, and which in despair threw out
a venturesome root, reached the coveted soil,
buried itself there, and gained a solid footing,
so that by degrees, although a motionless thing,
it changed its place, let its original roots die,
left the stones, and lived resuscitated upon the
organ that had set it free. I have known elms
which were going to eat up the soil of a fertile
field, whose food had been cut off from them by
a wide ditch, and who therefore determined to
make their uncut roots pass under the ditch.
They succeeded, and returned to their regular
food, much to the cultivator's astonishment. I
knew an heroic jasmine which went eight times
through holes in a board which kept the light
away from it, and which a teasing observer
would put back into the shade, hoping at last
to wear out the flower's energy; but he did not
succeed.</p>

<p>"A plant breathes, drinks, eats, selects, refuses,
seeks, works, lives, acts according to its instincts.
One does 'like a charm,' another pines, a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
is nervous and agitated. The sensitive-plant
shivers and droops its leaves at the slightest
touch. In certain hours of well-being the calla
lily is warm, the pink is phosphorescent, the
valisneria goes down to the bottom of the lake
to ripen the fruit of her loves. In these manifestations
of an unknown life the philosopher
cannot help recognizing a song from the universal
choir in the plant world.</p>

<p>"I go no further for the human soul just
now, although it is incomparably superior to
the soul of a plant, and although it has created
an intellectual world as much above the
rest of the terrestrial world as the stars are
higher than the Earth. I am not looking at
it now from the point of view of its spiritual
faculties, but only as force animating the human
being.</p>

<p>"Ah! I wonder that that force can group the
atoms that we breathe, or that we assimilate by
nutrition and form this charming being! Think
of that young girl the day she was born, and
follow in thought the gradual development of
that little body through the years of her awkward
age to the first graces of youth and the
charms of womanhood. How is human organism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
nourished, developed, and composed? You
know,&mdash;by respiration and nutrition.</p>

<p>"The air supplies three quarters of our nourishment
by respiration. The oxygen in the air
maintains the fire of life, and the body is comparable
to a flame, constantly renewed by the
principles of combustion. The lack of oxygen
extinguishes life as it extinguishes a lamp. By
respiration the black venous blood is transformed
into red arterial blood and regenerated. The
lungs are a fine tissue pierced with from forty
to fifty millions of little holes, which are just
too small for the blood to filter through, and
just large enough for the air to penetrate them.
A perpetual interchange of gas takes place
between the air and the blood, the first furnishing
the second with oxygen, the second
eliminating carbonic acid. On the one hand
the atmospheric oxygen burns carbon in the
lung; on the other the lung exhales carbonic
acid, nitrogen, and water in the form of vapor.
In the daytime, plants breathe by an opposite
process,&mdash;they absorb carbonic acid and exhale
oxygen; by this difference maintaining
one part of the general equilibrium of terrestrial
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
"Of what is the human body composed? An
average adult man weighs 70 kilograms. Of
this amount there are nearly 52 kilograms of
water in the blood and flesh. Analyze the substance
of our body, you will find albumen, fibrine,
caseine, and gelatine; that is, organic substances
composed originally of the four essential gases,&mdash;oxygen,
nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic
acid. You will also find substances with no
nitrogen, such as gum, sugar, starch, and fat.
These matters likewise pass through our organism;
their carbon and hydrogen are consumed
by the oxygen breathed in during respiration,
and then exhaled under the form of carbonic
acid and water.</p>

<p>"You are not unaware that water is a combination
of two gases, oxygen and hydrogen; the
air is a mixture of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen,
to which are added in lesser proportions
water in the form of vapor, which, however, is
but condensed oxygen, etc.</p>

<p>"Thus our body is composed only of transformed
gases."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>"But," interrupted my companion, "we do
not live solely upon the air; at certain hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
indicated by our stomachs, it is very necessary
to add some supplies which are not without a
value of their own,&mdash;such as a pheasant's
wing, a filet de sole, a glass of Château Laffitte
or champagne, or, as your taste may prefer,
asparagus, grapes, peaches...."</p>

<p>"Yes, that all passes through our organism
and renews its tissues,&mdash;pretty rapidly too; for
in a few months (not in seven years, as was
formerly thought) our body is entirely renewed.
To return to that lovely being who posed before
us just now. None of that flesh which we admired
existed three or four months ago; those
shoulders, that face, those eyes, that mouth,
those arms, that hair, and, even to the very nails,
all that organism, is but a current of molecules,
a ceaselessly renewed flame, a river which we
may look at all our lives, but never see the same
water again. Now, all that is but assimilated
gas, condensed and modified, and more than
anything else, it is air. These bones themselves,
so solid now, were formed and hardened
gradually. Do not forget that our whole body
is composed of invisible molecules which do
not touch each other, and which are continually
renewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
"Finally, our table is spread with vegetables
and fruits; if we are vegetarians we absorb substances
almost entirely drawn from the air. This
peach is air and water; this pear, this grape,
this almond are also made of air and water, a
few gaseous elements drawn to them by the sap,
by solar heat, by the rain. Asparagus or salad,
peas or beans, lettuce or chicory, all these live
in the air and on the air; what the earth furnishes,
what the sap seeks out, are also gases,
and the very same nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon, etc.</p>

<p>"If it is a question of beefsteak, chicken, or
some other 'meat,' the difference is not very
great. Sheep and oxen feed upon grass. If we
relish a partridge cooked with cauliflower, a
roasted quail, a truffled turkey, or a stewed hare,
all these substances, apparently so different, are
only transformed vegetable matter, which itself
is but a grouping of molecules taken from the
gases of which we have just been speaking,&mdash;air,
water, elements, molecules, and atoms almost
imponderable of themselves, and moreover absolutely
invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>"Thus, whatever may be our kind of nourishment,
our body, kept repaired, developed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
absorption of molecules acquired by respiration
and alimentation, is really but a current incessantly
renewed by means of this assimilation,&mdash;directed,
governed, and organized by the immaterial
force which animates us. To this force
we may assuredly give the name of 'soul.' It
groups the atoms which suit it, eliminates those
which are useless to it, and, starting with an
imperceptible speck, an indiscernible germ, ends
by building up the Apollo Belvidere or the
Venus of the Capitol. Phidias is but a coarse
imitator, compared to this hidden and mysterious
force. Mythology tells us that Pygmalion
became the lover of a statue of his own creation.
Not so! Pygmalion, Praxiteles, Michael Angelo,
Benvenuto, and Canova created nothing but
statues. The force that can construct the living
body of man and woman is more sublime.</p>

<p>"But this force is immaterial, invisible, intangible,
imponderable, like the attraction which lulls
the worlds in the universal melody; and the
body, however material it may seem to us, is in
itself only a harmonious grouping, formed by
the attraction of this interior force. So you
see that I confine myself strictly within the limits
of positive science in speaking of this young girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
by the title of a soul clothed with air,&mdash;like
you or me, for instance, neither more nor less.</p>

<p>"From the origin of humanity down to within
a century or two, it has been believed that sensation
was perceived at the very point where it
was felt. A pain felt in the finger was considered
as having its seat in the finger itself. Children
and many people believe so still. Physiology
has demonstrated that the impression is
transmitted from the finger-tip to the brain by
means of the nervous system. If the nerve is
cut, the finger may be burned with impunity;
the paralysis is complete. We have been able to
determine the time taken by the impression in
transmitting itself from any part of the body to
the brain, and it is known that the rapidity of
this transmission is about twenty-eight metres
per second. Since then we have referred sensation
to the brain. But we have stopped half way.</p>

<p>"The brain is matter, like the finger, and by
no means fixed and stable matter. It is essentially
changing matter, rapidly variable, and
forming no identity. A single lobe, a single
cell, a single molecule which does not change,
does not and could not exist in the whole mass
of encephalic matter. A stoppage of motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of circulation, or of transformation would be
a death-warrant. The brain subsists and feels,
only on condition of submitting, like all the
rest of the body, to the incessant transformations
of organic matter which constitute the
vital circuit.</p>

<p>"So it cannot be that our personality, our
identity, lies in a certain grouping of cerebral
matter,&mdash;our individual me, our <i>ego</i> which acquires
and preserves a personal scientific and
moral value, increasing with study; our <i>ego</i>
which feels itself responsible for its acts performed
a month, a year, ten, twenty, fifty years
ago, during which time however the molecular
grouping has been <i>changed</i> frequently.</p>

<p>"Physiologists who affirm that the soul does
not exist, are like their ancestors who affirmed
that they felt pain in their finger or their foot.
They are a little less far from the truth, but
they stop on the way when they stop at the
brain, and make the human being consist of
cerebral impressions. This hypothesis is all the
less excusable because these same physiologists
know perfectly well that personal sensation is
always accompanied by a modification of substance.
In other words, the <i>ego</i> of the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
only continues when the identity of its
matter ceases to continue.</p>

<p>"Our principle of sensibility, then, cannot be
a material object; it is put in communication
with the universe by cerebral impressions, by the
chemical forces disengaged in the encephalon in
consequence of material combinations. But it
is <i>different</i>.</p>

<p>"And our organic constitution is perpetually
transformed under the direction of a psychic
principle.</p>

<p>"Some molecule now incorporated in our organism
escapes from it by expiration, perspiration,
etc., to belong to the atmosphere for a longer
or shorter time, then to be incorporated into another
organism,&mdash;plant, animal, or man. The
molecules which actually constitute your body
were not all made part of your person yesterday,
and none of them were there three months ago.
Where were they? Either in the air or in another
body. All the molecules now forming
your organic tissues, your lungs, your eyes, your
brain, your legs, etc., have already served to
form other organic tissues. We are all resuscitated
dead men, made from the dust of our
ancestors. If all the people who have lived up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to this time arose from the dead, there would be
five of them to every square foot upon the surface
of all the continents,&mdash;obliged to climb on
one another's shoulders in order to stand; but
they could not all be completely resuscitated, for
many of the molecules have served successively
for several bodies.</p>

<p>"Our own organisms likewise, resolved into
their ultimate particles, will help to form the
bodies of our descendants.</p>

<p>"Each molecule of air then goes on eternally
from life to life, and escapes thence from death
to death, by turns wind, wave, earth, animal,
or flower. It is incorporated successively into
the substance of numberless organisms. The
air, the inexhaustible source whence everything
that lives takes its breath, is yet an immense
reservoir into which everything that dies pours
its last sigh; by its absorption, vegetable and
animal, different organisms come to life and
afterwards perish. Life and death are both in
the air we breathe, and perpetually succeed each
other by the exchange of gaseous molecules; the
molecule of oxygen which this old oak exhales
will fly away to the lungs of a child in its cradle.
The last sighs of a man will weave the brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
corolla of a flower, or expand like a smile over
the verdant meadow. And thus by an infinite
series of partial deaths, the atmosphere incessantly
nourishes the universal life spread over
the surface of the world.</p>

<p>"And if nevertheless some objection should
still remain unanswered, I would go further, and
add that our clothes as well as our bodies are
composed of substances which at first were all
gaseous. Take this thread, draw it out: what
a resistance! How many webs of cambric,
silk, linen, cotton, and wool industry have been
formed by the help of these warps and woofs!
And yet, what is a thread of linen, flax, or cotton?
Globules of air in juxtaposition which are
held together only by their molecular force.
What is a thread of silk or wool? Another set
of molecules in juxtaposition. Admit, then,
that our clothes as well are air, gas, substances
drawn in the beginning from the atmosphere,&mdash;oxygen,
nitrogen, carbon, vapor of water, etc."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see," said the painter, "that
art is not so far from science as is supposed in
certain circles. If your theory is purely scientific
to you, to me it is art, and of the best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Besides, do all these distinctions exist in Nature?
In Nature there is neither art nor painting nor
sculpture, music nor decoration, philosophy nor
chemistry, nor astronomy nor meteorology. Look
at the sky, the sea, those foot-hills of the Alps,
those rosy evening clouds, those luminous perspectives
towards the Italian coast,&mdash;all that is
one. There is unity in everything. And since
molecular philosophy demonstrates that there
is no longer any body, that even the atoms in
a bar of steel or platinum do not touch each
other, no one will be the loser, provided our
souls are left us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a fact against which no prejudice
can prevail,&mdash;living beings are souls
clothed with air. I pity the worlds deprived
of their atmosphere."</p>

<p>We had returned to the seashore after a long
ramble not far from our point of departure, and
were passing the battlemented wall of a villa on
our way from Beaulieu to Cape Ferrat, when two
very fashionably dressed ladies passed us. They
were the Duchess of V&mdash;&mdash; and her daughter,
whom we had met the previous Thursday at a
ball at the Préfecture. We bowed to them, and
disappeared under the olive-trees. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
girl, inquisitive daughter of Eve, turned to look
after us, and it seemed to me that a sudden
blush crimsoned her cheeks; it was doubtless
the reflection of the setting sun's rays.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">

</div>

<p>"Perhaps you think," said the artist, also
looking back, "that you have diminished my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
admiration for beauty? No, I appreciate it
still more. In it I bow to harmony; and&mdash;shall
I confess it?&mdash;the human body thus considered
as the manifestation to the senses of a
directing soul seems to me to acquire thence
more nobility, more beauty, and more light."</p>

<span class="smaller">AD VERITATEM PER SCIENTIAM.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS studying in my library the conditions
of life upon the surface of worlds governed
and illuminated by suns of different sizes,
when glancing at the chimney-piece I was
struck with the expression&mdash;I had almost said
the animation&mdash;of my dear Urania's face.
It was the gracious, living expression which<span class="pagenum in2"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
once&mdash;ah! how quickly the earth goes round,
and how short a quarter of a century is!&mdash;which
once&mdash;and it seems to me like yesterday&mdash;which
once&mdash;in those youthful days so quickly
flown&mdash;had attracted my thoughts and inflamed
my heart. I could not keep from looking at her
again, and resting my eyes on her. Truly, she
was still just as beautiful, and my feelings had
not changed. She drew me to her as the light
draws an insect. I rose from my table to approach
her, and see again the singular effect of
the daylight on her changing face, and I surprised
myself by standing before her, forgetting
my work.</p>

<p>Her look seemed to be lost in the distance, yet
she was looking. At what? I had the firm
conviction that she was really looking at something;
and following the direction of that
fixed, motionless, solemn, although not severe
gaze, my eyes went straight to Spero's portrait,
hanging there between two book-cases. Really,
Urania was looking fixedly at him.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/illo_304.jpg" width="264" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly the picture broke away from the
wall and fell, breaking the frame. I rushed
to it. The portrait was lying on the carpet,
and Spero's gentle face was turned towards me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Picking it up, I found a large paper, grown yellow,
which filled up the whole back, and was written
over on both sides in Spero's handwriting.
Why had I never noticed this paper? It is true
that it might have lain under the setting of the
frame, hidden beneath the protecting cardboard
mat. When I brought this water-color back from
Christiania I
did not think of
examining its
arrangement.
But who could
have had the
singular idea
of putting this
sheet in such
a place? I
recognized my
friend's handwriting,
and glanced over the two pages in
utter bewilderment. According to all appearances
they must have been written on the last
day of the young student's life,&mdash;the day of
his ascension to the aurora borealis. Probably
Icléa's father wished to preserve these
last thoughts carefully, so framed them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Spero's portrait, and forgot to mention it when
he afterwards gave me the portrait as a memento,
on my return from the pilgrimage to my
two friends' graves. However that might be,
placing the water-color gently on the table, I
experienced the deepest emotion as I recognized
every detail of that dear face. They were his
very eyes, so sweet, so deep, and always unfathomable;
the wide brow apparently so calm, the
delicate mouth with its reserved sensitiveness,
the fresh coloring of the face, neck, and hands.
His eyes looked at me, whichever way I turned
the portrait; they looked at Urania at the same
time; they looked everywhere at once. Strange
idea of the artist! I could not resist the thought
of Urania's eyes, which had seemed to me to be
looking at the portrait with embarrassing intentness.
Her celestial countenance no longer wore
the same expression at all, but appeared to me
rather to be melancholy, almost sad. Then I
turned again to the mysterious sheet of paper.
It was written in a clear, precise hand, with no
erasures. I offer it to the readers of this book
just as I found it, without the slightest change;
for it appears to be the very natural conclusion
of the preceding episodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Here it is, <i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the scientific testament of a mind which
on the Earth did all in its power to remain independent
of the weight of matter, and which hopes to be
freed from it.</p>

<p>I should like to leave the results of my researches
in the form of aphorisms. It seems to me that the
Truth can be reached only through the study of
Nature, that is to say, by science. Here are the
inductions which appear to me to be founded on
this method of observation.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The visible, tangible, ponderable, and constantly
moving universe is composed of invisible, intangible,
imponderable, and inert atoms.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>These atoms are governed by force, to constitute
bodies and to organize beings.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Force is essential entity.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Visibility, tangibility, solidity, and weight are relative
properties, and not absolute realities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The infinitely small.</p>

<p>The experiments made in beating gold-leaf show
that ten thousand leaves are contained in the thickness
of a millimetre. A millimetre has been divided
on a glass plate into a thousand equal parts; and
infusoria exist, which are so small that their entire
bodies, placed between two of these divisions, do not
touch either of them. The members and organs of
these beings are composed of cellules, these of molecules,
and these of atoms. Twenty cubic centimetres
of oil spread over a lake will cover four thousand
square metres, so that the layer of oil thus expanded
measures only one two hundred thousandth of a millimetre
in thickness. Spectral analysis of light discloses
the presence of a millionth of a milligramme
of sodium in a flame. The sense of smell perceives
1/604000000 a milligramme of mercaptan in the
air breathed. The dimensions of atoms must be
less than a millionth of a millimetre in diameter.
[Waves of light are comprised between 4 and 8
ten millionths of a millimetre, from violet to red;
2300 are required to fill a millimetre. In the duration
of a second the ether through which light is
transmitted makes 700,000,000,000,000 oscillations,
each of which is mathematically defined.]</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The intangible, invisible atom, scarcely conceivable
to our mind accustomed to superficial judgments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>constitutes the only true matter; and what we call
matter is but an effect produced on our senses by the
motion of atoms,&mdash;that is to say, an incessant possibility
of sensations.</p>

<p>The result is, that matter, like the manifestations
of energy, is only a mode of motion. If motion
should stop; if force should be annihilated; if the
temperature of bodies should be reduced to absolute
zero,&mdash;matter, as we know it, would cease to exist.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The visible universe is composed of invisible bodies.
What we see is made up of things which are not
seen. There is but one kind of primitive atom.
The constituent molecules of different bodies&mdash;iron,
gold, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.&mdash;differ only in the
number, grouping, and motion of the atoms which
compose them.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>What we call "matter," vanishes when scientific
analysis thinks to grasp it. But we find as the
support of the universe and the origin of all form,
Force,&mdash;the dynamic element. By my will I can
unsettle the Moon in her course.</p>

<p>The movements of each atom on our Earth are
the mathematical resultant of the undulations of
the luminiferous ether which come to it in time
from the abysses of infinite space.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The human being has for essential principle the
soul. The body is visible and transitory.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Atoms are indestructible.</p>

<p>The energy which moves atoms and governs the
universe is indestructible.</p>

<p>The human soul is indestructible.</p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>The individuality of the soul is recent in the
Earth's history. Our planet was nebula, then sun,
after that, chaos. No terrestrial human being was
then in existence. Life began with the most rudimentary
organisms; it has progressed century by
century to attain its present state, which is not
the last. What we call the faculties of the soul,&mdash;intelligence,
reason, conscience,&mdash;are modern. The
mind has gradually freed itself from matter; as&mdash;if
the comparison were not awkward&mdash;gas frees
itself from coal, perfume from the flower, flame from
fire.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>Psychic force has been beginning to assert itself
in the higher spheres of terrestrial humanity for
the past thirty or forty centuries; its action is but
in its dawn. Souls conscious of their individuality,
or still unconscious of it, are by their very nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>beyond the conditions of space and time. After
the death of the body, as during life, they occupy
no place; perhaps some of them go to dwell in other
worlds. Those only who are freed from material
bonds can be conscious of their extra-corporeal existence
and immortality.</p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>The Earth is but a province of the eternal fatherland;
it forms a part of heaven. <i>Heaven is infinite</i>;
all worlds are a part of heaven.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>The planetary and sidereal systems which constitute
the universe are at different degrees of organization
and advancement. The extent of their diversity
is infinite; beings are everywhere appropriate to their
worlds.</p>

<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>All worlds are not lived upon. The present era is
of no more importance than are those which preceded
or those which will follow it. Some worlds have been
inhabited in the past, others will be in the future.
Some day nothing will remain of the Earth; even its
ruins will have perished.</p>

<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>Terrestrial life is not the type of other lives. An
unlimited diversity reigns in the universe. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>are dwelling-places where the weight is intense,
where light is unknown, where touch, smell, and
hearing are the only senses, where, the optic nerve
not being formed, all the beings are blind. There
are others where the beings are so light and so slight
that they would be invisible to earthly eyes, where
senses of an exquisite delicacy reveal to privileged
beings sensations forbidden to terrestrial humanity.</p>

<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>The space existing between the worlds distributed
over the immense universe does not separate them
from each other. They are all in perpetual communication,
from the attraction which makes itself
felt through all distance, and establishes an indissoluble
link between all worlds.</p>

<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>The universe forms a single unity.</p>

<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>The system of the physical world is the material
basis, the habitat of the moral or spiritual world.
Hence astronomy must be the basis of all philosophical
and religious belief. Every thinking being bears
within himself the consciousness, but the uncertainty,
of immortality. This is because we are the microscopic
wheels of an unknown mechanism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>Man makes his own destiny. He rises or falls
in accordance with his works. Beings attached to
material riches, misers, hypocrites, liars, ambitious
people, live like the perverse, in the lower zones.</p>

<p>But a primordial and absolute law governs creation,&mdash;the
law of Progress. Everything rises in
the infinite. Sins are falls.</p>

<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>In the ascension of souls, moral qualities have
no less value than intellectual qualities. Goodness,
devotion, self-abnegation, sacrifice, purify the soul,
and raise it, like study and science.</p>

<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>Universal creation is an immense harmony, of
which the Earth is but an insignificant, rather uninteresting,
and unfinished fragment.</p>

<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>Nature is a perpetual future. <i>Progress is law.</i>
Progression is eternal.</p>

<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>The eternity of a soul would not be long enough
to visit the infinite and learn all there is to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>The soul's destiny is to free itself more and more
from the material world, and to belong to the lofty
Uranian life, whence it can look down upon matter and
suffer no more. It then enters upon the spiritual life,
eternally pure. The supreme aim of all beings is the
perpetual approach to absolute perfection and divine
happiness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Spero's scientific and philosophical
testament. Does it not seem to have been
dictated by Urania herself?</p>

<p>The Nine Muses of ancient mythology were
sisters. Modern scientific conceptions in their
turn tend to unity. Astronomy, or the knowledge
of the world, and psychology, or knowledge
of being, unite to-day to establish the only basis
on which definite philosophy can be built.</p>

which he had been waiting so anxiously to make his aerial journey.
It is well known that the aurora borealis causes magnetic
disturbances which are felt at long distances from their
